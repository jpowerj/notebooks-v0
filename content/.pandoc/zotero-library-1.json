The essays in this book challenge that view, arguing that Khomeini and his Islamic movement should be seen as a form of Third World political populism—a radical but pragmatic middle-class movement that strives to enter, rather than reject, the modern age.Ervand Abrahamian, while critical of Khomeini, asks us to look directly at the Ayatollah's own works and to understand what they meant to his principal audience—his followers in Iran. Abrahamian analyzes political tracts dating back to 1943, along with Khomeini's theological writings and his many public statements in the form of speeches, interviews, proclamations and fatwas (judicial decrees). What emerges, according to Abrahamian, is a militant, sometimes contradictory, political ideology that focuses not on issues of scripture and theology but on the immediate political, social, and economic grievances of workers and the middle class.These essays reveal how the Islamic Republic has systematically manipulated history through televised \"recantations,\" newspapers, school textbooks, and even postage stamps. All are designed to bolster the clergy's reputation as champions of the downtrodden and as defenders against foreign powers. Abrahamian also discusses the paranoia that permeates the political spectrum in Iran, contending that such deep distrust is symptomatic of populist regimes everywhere.","author":[{"family":"Abrahamian","given":"Ervand"}],"citation-key":"abrahamian1993khomeinism","ISBN":"978-0-520-08503-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",10,29]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"208","publisher":"University of California Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Khomeinism: Essays on the Islamic Republic","title-short":"Khomeinism","type":"book"},{"id":"abramitzky2014book","abstract":"We use book translations as a new measure of international idea flows and study the effects of Communism's collapse in Eastern Europe on these flows.

The revolution has been overwhelmed by clashes between rival counter-revolutionary forces: resilient old regimes on the one hand and Islamic fundamentalist contenders on the other.  In this eagerly awaited book, foremost Arab world and international affairs specialist Gilbert Achcar analyzes the factors of the regional relapse. Focusing on Syria and Egypt, Achcar assesses the present stage of the uprising and the main obstacles, both regional and international, that prevent any resolution. In Syria, the regime's brutality has fostered the rise of jihadist forces, among which the so-called Islamic State emerged as the most ruthless and powerful. In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood's year in power was ultimately terminated by the contradictory conjunction of a second revolutionary wave and a bloody reactionary coup. Events in Syria and Egypt offer salient examples of a pattern of events happening across the Middle East.  Morbid Symptoms offers a timely analysis of the ongoing Arab uprising that will engage experts and general readers alike. Drawing on a unique combination of scholarly and political knowledge of the Arab region, Achcar argues that, short of radical social change, the region will not achieve stability any time soon.","author":[{"family":"Achcar","given":"Gilbert"}],"citation-key":"achcar2016morbid","ISBN":"978-1-5036-0047-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5,25]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"241","publisher":"Stanford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Morbid Symptoms: Relapse in the Arab Uprising","title-short":"Morbid Symptoms","type":"book"},{"id":"adams1989incremental","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Adams","given":"Jan S."}],"citation-key":"adams1989incremental","container-title":"Slavic Review","DOI":"10.2307/2499786","ISSN":"0037-6779","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1989"]]},"page":"614-630","publisher":"Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies","source":"JSTOR","title":"Incremental Activism in Soviet Third World Policy: The Role of the International Department of the CPSU Central Committee","title-short":"Incremental Activism in Soviet Third World Policy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2499786","volume":"48"},{"id":"adamson1977marx","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Adamson","given":"Walter L."}],"citation-key":"adamson1977marx","container-title":"The Review of Politics","ISSN":"0034-6705","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1977"]]},"page":"363-385","publisher":"[University of Notre Dame du lac on behalf of Review of Politics, Cambridge University Press]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Marx and Political Education","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1405972","volume":"39"},{"id":"adorno1950authoritarian","abstract":"Hugely influential study of the psychology of authoritarianismWhat makes a fascist?

Alexander has amassed, from disparate sources, an unprecedented amount of primary and secondary material to provide a documentary history of the origins, development, and nature of the Trotskyist movement around the world. Drawing on interviews and correspondence with Trotskyists, newspaper reports and pamphlets, historical writings including the annotated writings of Trotsky in both English and French, historical memoirs of Trotskyist leaders, and documents of the Fourth International, Alexander recounts the history of the movement since Trotsky's exile from the Soviet Union in 1929. Organized alphabetically in a double-column, country-by-country format this book charts the formation and growth of Trotskyism in more than sixty-five countries, providing biographic information about its most influential leaders, detailed accounts of Trotsky's personal involvement in the development of the movement in each country, and thorough reports of its various factions and splits. Multiple chapters are reserved for countries where the movement was more active or fully developed and various chapters are organized around crucial thematic issues, such as the Fourth International.

Structuralism constituted an intellectual revolution in the 1960s and 1970s and radically transformed the way philosophy, political and social theory, history, science, and aesthetics were discussed and thought about. For Marx was a key contribution to that process and it fundamentally recast the way in which many people understood Marx and Marxism.This book contains the classic statements of Althusser's analysis of the young Marx and the importance of Feuerbach during this formative period, of his thesis of the \"epistomological break\" between the early and the late Marx, and of his conception of dialectics, contradiction and \"overdetermination.\" Also included is a study of the materialist theater of Bertolazzi and Brecht and the critique of humanist readings of Marxism.

Rather than providing us with an account of Marx as an exclusively class-based thinker, Anderson here offers a portrait of Marx for the twenty-first century: a global theorist whose social critique was sensitive to the varieties of human social and historical development, including not just class, but nationalism, race, and ethnicity, as well. Marx at the Margins ultimately argues that alongside his overarching critique of capital, Marx created a theory of history that was multi-layered and not easily reduced to a single model of development or revolution.

We normally think of government as something only the state does, yet many of us are governed far more—and far more obtrusively—by the private government of the workplace. In this provocative and compelling book, Elizabeth Anderson argues that the failure to see this stems from long-standing confusions. These confusions explain why, despite all evidence to the contrary, we still talk as if free markets make workers free—and why so many employers advocate less government even while they act as dictators in their businesses.In many workplaces, employers minutely regulate workers' speech, clothing, and manners, leaving them with little privacy and few other rights. And employers often extend their authority to workers' off-duty lives. Workers can be fired for their political speech, recreational activities, diet, and almost anything else employers care to govern. Yet we continue to talk as if early advocates of market society—from John Locke and Adam Smith to Thomas Paine and Abraham Lincoln—were right when they argued that it would free workers from oppressive authorities.

Suspicious of the inevitability so often imposed by hindsight, Hannah Arendt was not interested in detailing the causes that produced totalitarianism. Nothing in the nineteenth century--indeed, nothing in human history--could have prepared us for the idea of political domination achieved by organizing the infinite plurality and differentiation of human beings as if all humanity were just one individual. Arendt believed that such a development marked a grotesque departure from all that had come before.  In The Origins of Totalitarianism, Arendt sought to provide an historical account of the forces that crystallized into totalitarianism: The ebb and flow of nineteenth-century anti-Semitism (she deemed the Dreyfus Affair a dress rehearsal for the Final Solution) and he rise of European imperialism, accompanied by the invention of racism as the only possible rationalization for it. For Arendt, totalitarianism was a form of governance that eliminated the very possibility of political action. Totalitarian leaders attract both mobs and elites, take advantage of the unthinkability of their atrocities, target \"objective enemies\" (classes of people who are liquidated simply because of their group membership), use terror to create loyalty, rely on concentration camps, and are obsessive in their pursuit of global primacy. But even more presciently, Arendt understood that totalitarian solutions could well survive the demise of totalitarian regimes.  The Origins of Totalitarianism remains as essential a book for understanding our times as it was when it first appeared more than fifty years ago.","author":[{"family":"Arendt","given":"Hannah"}],"citation-key":"arendt1951origins","ISBN":"978-0-8052-4225-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1951"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"674","publisher":"Schocken Books","source":"Google Books","title":"The Origins of Totalitarianism","type":"book"},{"id":"arieli2020speed","abstract":"New ways of doing things often get started through the actions of a few innovators, then diffuse rapidly as more and more people come into contact with prior adopters in their social network. Much of the literature focuses on the speed of diffusion as a function of the network topology. In practice, the topology may not be known with any precision, and it is constantly in flux as links are formed and severed. Here, we establish an upper bound on the expected waiting time until a given proportion of the population has adopted that holds independently of the network structure. Kreindler and Young (2014) demonstrated such a bound for regular networks when agents choose between two options: the innovation and the status quo. Our bound holds for directed and undirected networks of arbitrary size and degree distribution, and for multiple competing innovations with different payoffs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Arieli","given":"Itai"},{"family":"Babichenko","given":"Yakov"},{"family":"Peretz","given":"Ron"},{"family":"Young","given":"H.

This came into Marx’s hands in his capacity as editor of the Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher in which it was duly published.1 Marx studied it again when he himself turned to the subject in 1844, and in his own publications he continually praised it. However, when Marx indicated that he intended to write a big work on economics, Engels seems to have happily resigned the matter to him, for he had many other interests.

We use attendance in a controversial economics training program that 40% of federal judges attended by 1990, a policy change giving judges more sentencing discretion, random assignment of judges to control for court- and case-level factors, an exogenous seating network from random panel composition to trace the spread of economic reasoning in law, and ordering of cases within Circuit to identify memetic economic ideas that move across legal topics. We find that judges who use law and economics language vote for and author conservative verdicts in economics cases and are more opposed to government regulation and criminal appeals. After attending Henry Manne's economics training program, judges use more economics language and render conservative verdicts in economics cases and reject criminal appeals, and this result is robust to a large set of judge biographical controls. Manne economics training is more predictive of these decisions than political party. Manne judges render 20% harsher (10 months longer) criminal sentences after U.S. v. Booker allowed more sentencing discretion. They also impact criminal appeals verdicts when not authoring the opinion. Judges exposed to Manne peers increase their use of economics language in subsequent opinions. Ideas such as “optimal deterrence”, “capital”, and “law and economics” move across legal topics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Ash","given":"Elliott"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Daniel L."},{"family":"Naidu","given":"Suresh"}],"citation-key":"ash2017ideas","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,26]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 2992782","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Ideas Have Consequences: The Effect of Law and Economics on American Justice","title-short":"Ideas Have Consequences","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2992782"},{"id":"ash2019case","author":[{"family":"Ash","given":"Elliott"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Daniel L"}],"citation-key":"ash2019case","container-title":"Law as Data, Santa Fe Institute Press, ed.

Rapid relative wage growth at the bottom of the distribution reduced the college wage premium and counteracted around one-third of the four-decade increase in aggregate 90/10 log wage inequality. Wage compression was accompanied by rapid nominal wage growth and rising job-to-job separations—especially among young non-college (high school or less) workers. Comparing across states, post-pandemic labor market tightness became strongly predictive of real wage growth among low-wage workers (wage-Phillips curve), and aggregate wage compression. Simultaneously, the wage-separation elasticity—a key measure of labor market competition—rose among young non-college workers, with wage gains concentrated among workers who changed employers. Seen through the lens of a canonical job ladder model, the pandemic reduced employer market power by increasing the elasticity of labor supply to firms in the low-wage labor market. This spurred rapid relative wage growth among young non-college workers, who disproportionately moved from lower-paying to higher-paying and potentially more productive jobs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Autor","given":"David"},{"family":"Dube","given":"Arindrajit"},{"family":"McGrew","given":"Annie"}],"citation-key":"autor2023unexpected","collection-title":"Working Paper Series","DOI":"10.3386/w31010","genre":"Working Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3]]},"number":"31010","publisher":"National Bureau of Economic Research","source":"National Bureau of Economic Research","title":"The Unexpected Compression: Competition at Work in the Low Wage Labor Market","title-short":"The Unexpected Compression","type":"article","URL":"https://www.nber.org/papers/w31010"},{"id":"avineri1967hegelian","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Avineri","given":"Shlomo"}],"citation-key":"avineri1967hegelian","container-title":"The Review of Metaphysics","ISSN":"0034-6632","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1967"]]},"page":"33-56","publisher":"Philosophy Education Society Inc.","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Hegelian Origins of Marx's Political Thought","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/20124495","volume":"21"},{"id":"avineri1968social","abstract":"Ever since the discovery of Marx's Early Writings, most of the literature concerned with Marx's intellectual development has centred around the so-called gap between the 'young' Marx, who was considered to be a humanist thinker, and the 'older' Marx, who was held to be a determinist with little concern for anything outside his narrow theory of historical materialism.

Some essays study the ways in which the revolutionaries' break with the past was prepared by competition between agents and critics of absolute monarchy to control the cultural resources and political meanings of French sought before 1789 to reconstitute their body politic; and by the invention of 'public opinion' as a new form of political authority displacing notions of 'representation', 'constitution', 'sovereignty' - and of 'the French Revolution' itself - the ambiguities, tensions, and contradictions that were to drive the revolutionary dynamic in subsequent years. The result is a substantial and unified set of studies, stimulating renewed reflection on one of the central themes in modern European history.","author":[{"family":"Baker","given":"Keith M."}],"citation-key":"baker1990inventing","ISBN":"978-0-521-38578-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1990",1,26]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"388","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Inventing the French Revolution: Essays on French Political Culture in the Eighteenth Century","title-short":"Inventing the French Revolution `","type":"book"},{"id":"baker1993corpus","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Baker","given":"Mona"}],"citation-key":"baker1993corpus","container-title":"Text and Technology: In honour of John Sinclair","event-place":"Amsterdam","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993"]]},"language":"English","page":"233-250","publisher":"John Benjamins Publishing Company","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","title":"Corpus Linguistics and Translation Studies: Implications and Applications","type":"chapter","URL":"https://benjamins.com/catalog/z.64.15bak"},{"id":"baker2016500","abstract":"Survey sheds light on the ‘crisis’ rocking research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Baker","given":"Monya"}],"citation-key":"baker2016500","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/533452a","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7604","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5,1]]},"language":"en","license":"2016 Springer Nature Limited","number":"7604","page":"452-454","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a","volume":"533"},{"id":"bakunin1990statism","abstract":"Statism and Anarchy is a complete English translation of the last work by the great Russian anarchist Michael Bakunin. It was written in 1873, in the aftermath of the rise of the German Empire and the clash between Bakunin and Karl Marx in the first International. Bakunin assesses the strength of a European state system dominated by Bismarck. Then, in the most remarkable part of the book, he assails the Marxist alternative, predicting that a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" will in fact be a dictatorship over the proletariat, and will produce a new class of socialist rulers. Instead, he outlines his vision of an anarchist society and identifies the social forces he believes will achieve an ananarchist revolution. Statism and Anarchy had an immediate influence on the \"to the people\" movement of Russian populism, and Bakunin's ideas inspired other anarchist movements. This is the only complete and reliable rendition of Statism and Anarchy in English, and in a lucid introduction Marshall Shatz locates Bakunin in his immediate historical and intellectual context, and assesses the impact of his ideas on the wider development of European radical thought. A guide to further reading and a chronology of events are appended as aids to students encountering Bakunin's thought for the first time.","author":[{"family":"Bakunin","given":"Mikhail Aleksandrovich"}],"citation-key":"bakunin1990statism","ISBN":"978-0-521-36973-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1990",11,30]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"300","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Statism and Anarchy","title-short":"Bakunin","type":"book"},{"id":"ball1984marx","abstract":"These twelve original essays are 'after' Marx in several senses. The first and most obvious is the purely chronological sense: They are written one hundred years after Marx's death. The authors are therefore able to see more clearly what Marx did not or could not see and to see more clearly that which he foresaw only dimly. The second sense in which they are after Marx is political: In this century virtually all revolutionaries call themselves Marxists and purport to apply Marx's precepts to political practice. Armed with their different interpretations of a nineteenth-century theory, they have altered - and continue to reshape - the political contours of the twentieth century. Marx raised more questions than he, or anyone else, could ever reasonably hope to answer. To raise anew some of these questions and to approach them in the critical spirit of Marx's own thinking, are the common themes running through and uniting these essays.","author":[{"family":"Ball","given":"Terence"},{"family":"Farr","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"ball1984marx","ISBN":"978-0-521-27661-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1984",6,29]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"308","publisher":"CUP Archive","source":"Google Books","title":"After Marx","type":"book"},{"id":"ballester2006who","abstract":"Finite population noncooperative games with linear-quadratic utilities, where each player decides how much action she exerts, can be interpreted as a network game with local payoff complementarities, together with a globally uniform payoff substitutability component and an own-concavity effect. For these games, the Nash equilibrium action of each player is proportional to her Bonacich centrality in the network of local complementarities, thus establishing a bridge with the sociology literature on social networks. This Bonacich-Nash linkage implies that aggregate equilibrium increases with network size and density. We then analyze a policy that consists of targeting the key player, that is, the player who, once removed, leads to the optimal change in aggregate activity. We provide a geometric characterization of the key player identified with an intercentrality measure, which takes into account both a player's centrality and her contribution to the centrality of the others.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Ballester","given":"Coralio"},{"family":"Calvó-Armengol","given":"Antoni"},{"family":"Zenou","given":"Yves"}],"citation-key":"ballester2006who","container-title":"Econometrica","ISSN":"0012-9682","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"1403-1417","publisher":"[Wiley, Econometric Society]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Who's Who in Networks.

Often such data is L2 normalized so that it lies on the surface of a unit hypersphere. Popular models such as (mixtures of) multi-variate Gaussians are inadequate for characterizing such data. This paper proposes a generative mixture-model approach to clustering directional data based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, which arises naturally for data distributed on the unit hypersphere. In particular, we derive and analyze two variants of the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework for estimating the mean and concentration parameters of this mixture. Numerical estimation of the concentration parameters is non-trivial in high dimensions since it involves functional inversion of ratios of Bessel functions. We also formulate two clustering algorithms corresponding to the variants of EM that we derive. Our approach provides a theoretical basis for the use of cosine similarity that has been widely employed by the information retrieval community, and obtains the spherical kmeans algorithm (kmeans with cosine similarity) as a special case of both variants. Empirical results on clustering of high-dimensional text and gene-expression data based on a mixture of vMF distributions show that the ability to estimate the concentration parameter for each vMF component, which is not present in existing approaches, yields superior results, especially for difficult clustering tasks in high-dimensional spaces.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Banerjee","given":"Arindam"},{"family":"Dhillon","given":"Inderjit S."},{"family":"Ghosh","given":"Joydeep"},{"family":"Sra","given":"Suvrit"}],"citation-key":"banerjee2005clustering","container-title":"J.

An ensemble of SVMs reaches 86.7% accuracy with 89.3% precision and 83.3% recall on this task. A preliminary analysis of the features used by the SVMs suggests that the distribution of function words and morphosyntactic categories in general, and personal pronouns and adverbs in particular, are among the cues used by the SVMs to perform the discrimination task. A follow-up experiment shows that the performance attained by SVMs is well above the average performance of ten human subjects, including five professional translators, on the same task. Our results offer solid evidence supporting the translationese hypothesis, and our method seems to have promising applications in translation studies and in quantitative style analysis in general. Implications for the machine learning/text categorization community are equally important, both because this is a novel application and especially because we provide explicit evidence that a relatively knowledge-poor machine learning algorithm can outperform human beings in a text classification task.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Baroni","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Bernardini","given":"Silvia"}],"citation-key":"baroni2006new","container-title":"Literary and Linguistic Computing","container-title-short":"Literary and Linguistic Computing","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqi039","ISSN":"0268-1145","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",9,1]]},"page":"259-274","source":"Silverchair","title":"A New Approach to the Study of Translationese: Machine-learning the Difference between Original and Translated Text","title-short":"A New Approach to the Study of Translationese","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqi039","volume":"21"},{"id":"baroud2003searching","abstract":"A searing testament to Israeli brutality and Palestinian resilience, spirit, and grace under pressure.

Its experiments provided a model for future revolutions and democracies across the globe, but this first modern revolution had no model to follow. Using reconstructed transcripts of debates held in the Revolution’s first parliament, we present a quantitative analysis of how this body managed innovation. We use information theory to track the creation, transmission, and destruction of word-use patterns across over 40,000 speeches and a thousand speakers. The parliament as a whole was biased toward the adoption of new patterns, but speakers’ individual qualities could break these overall trends. Speakers on the left innovated at higher rates, while speakers on the right acted to preserve prior patterns. Key players such as Robespierre (on the left) and Abbé Maury (on the right) played information-processing roles emblematic of their politics. Newly created organizational functions—such as the Assembly president and committee chairs—had significant effects on debate outcomes, and a distinct transition appears midway through the parliament when committees, external to the debate process, gained new powers to “propose and dispose.” Taken together, these quantitative results align with existing qualitative interpretations, but also reveal crucial information-processing dynamics that have hitherto been overlooked. Great orators had the public’s attention, but deputies (mostly on the political left) who mastered the committee system gained new powers to shape revolutionary legislation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Barron","given":"Alexander T.

We conceive of that process as leader-to-follower directional influence originating with Luther and flowing to local elites through personal ties. Based on novel data on Luther’s correspondence, Luther’s visits, and student enrollments in Luther’s city of Wittenberg, we reconstruct Luther’s influence network to examine whether local connections to him increased the odds of adopting Protestantism.

Examples are drawn from history, from contemporary events (including the investigation of Guantánamo ‘linguists’), from nonfictional writing (such as Daoud Hari’s The Translator), and from fiction (for example, Mia Couto’s Last Flight of the Flamingo). Real and fictional ‘case studies’ agree on the parlous status of the translator. The homo sacer is a literal out-law, that is, someone who is neither punished nor protected by the law. The concept owes much to that of the pharmakos as analyzed by Jacques Derrida, and both philosophers (Agamben and Derrida) claim to be reviving concepts from the classical world, among them the necessity of logos to the polis as posited by Aristotle. The article argues that by the nature of their profession, translators and interpreters in situations of conflict do not belong fully to any of the languages they are translating into and out of; to the non-bilinguals who hired them they seem to be speaking with a forked tongue and in cipher, abandoning logos in favour of mere phoné (voice) and hence moving outside the law of the polis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Beebee","given":"Thomas O."}],"citation-key":"beebee2010shoot","container-title":"The Translator","DOI":"10.1080/13556509.2010.10799473","ISSN":"1355-6509","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",11,1]]},"page":"295-313","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Shoot The Transtraitor!","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13556509.2010.10799473","volume":"16"},{"id":"beer1920history","abstract":"This is volume 1 in the set A History of British Socialism.

By contrast, the remainder of the century, after Hegel's death, has been relatively neglected because it has been seen as a period of stagnation and decline. But Frederick Beiser argues that the second half of the century was in fact one of the most revolutionary periods in modern philosophy because the nature of philosophy itself was up for grabs and the very absence of certainty led to creativity and the start of a new era. In this innovative concise history of German philosophy from 1840 to 1900, Beiser focuses not on themes or individual thinkers but rather on the period’s five great debates: the identity crisis of philosophy, the materialism controversy, the methods and limits of history, the pessimism controversy, and the Ignorabimusstreit. Schopenhauer and Wilhelm Dilthey play important roles in these controversies but so do many neglected figures, including Ludwig Büchner, Eugen Dühring, Eduard von Hartmann, Julius Fraunstaedt, Hermann Lotze, Adolf Trendelenburg, and two women, Agnes Taubert and Olga Pluemacher, who have been completely forgotten in histories of philosophy. The result is a wide-ranging, original, and surprising new account of German philosophy in the critical period between Hegel and the twentieth century.","author":[{"family":"Beiser","given":"Frederick C."}],"citation-key":"beiser_after_2014","ISBN":"978-1-4008-5253-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",9,7]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"245","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"After Hegel: German Philosophy, 1840–1900","title-short":"After Hegel","type":"book"},{"id":"bellos2011that","abstract":"A New York Times Notable Book for 2011 One of The Economist's 2011 Books of the Year People speak different languages, and always have. The Ancient Greeks took no notice of anything unless it was said in Greek; the Romans made everyone speak Latin; and in India, people learned their neighbors' languages—as did many ordinary Europeans in times past (Christopher Columbus knew Italian, Portuguese, and Castilian Spanish as well as the classical languages). But today, we all use translation to cope with the diversity of languages. Without translation there would be no world news, not much of a reading list in any subject at college, no repair manuals for cars or planes; we wouldn't even be able to put together flat-pack furniture. Is That a Fish in Your Ear? ranges across the whole of human experience, from foreign films to philosophy, to show why translation is at the heart of what we do and who we are. Among many other things, David Bellos asks: What's the difference between translating unprepared natural speech and translating Madame Bovary? How do you translate a joke? What's the difference between a native tongue and a learned one? Can you translate between any pair of languages, or only between some? What really goes on when world leaders speak at the UN? Can machines ever replace human translators, and if not, why? But the biggest question Bellos asks is this: How do we ever really know that we've understood what anybody else says—in our own language or in another?

Setting out from a comment made by Althusser – ‘[Spinoza] is the only direct ancestor of Marx’ – I try to demonstrate that even though the relationship between Spinoza and Marx has limited support at a historiographical level, a determined set of ideas of Spinoza can be connected to some of Marx’s political objectives in the period prior to 1845. This argument is supported through Marx’s notebooks devoted to studying Spinoza’s Theological-Political Treatise, written in 1841, and his refutation of Spinoza in The Holy Family. However, contrary to what could be expected, when Marx abandoned his most pronounced idealistic phase, within which Spinoza played a certain role, he rebelled against Spinozism at the same time. Nonetheless, it is one thing to repudiate Spinoza’s name, and a very different thing to repudiate Spinoza’s ideas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Bianchi","given":"Bernardo"}],"citation-key":"bianchi2018marx","container-title":"Historical Materialism","DOI":"10.1163/1569206X-00001482","ISSN":"1465-4466, 1569-206X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,17]]},"language":"eng","page":"35-58","publisher":"Brill","source":"brill.com","title":"Marx’s Reading of Spinoza: On the Alleged Influence of Spinoza on Marx","title-short":"Marx’s Reading of Spinoza","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/hima/26/4/article-p35_2.xml","volume":"26"},{"id":"bicchieri1993counterfactuals","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Bicchieri","given":"Cristina"}],"citation-key":"bicchieri1993counterfactuals","container-title":"Philosophical Topics","ISSN":"0276-2080","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993"]]},"page":"21-52","publisher":"University of Arkansas Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"Counterfactuals, Belief Changes, and Equilibrium Refinements","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/43154140","volume":"21"},{"id":"bicchieri1993rationality","abstract":"This book explores how individual actions coordinate to produce unintended social consequences. In the past this phenomenon has been explained as the outcome of rational, self-interested individual behaviour. Professor Bicchieri shows that this is in no way a satisfying explanation. She discusses how much knowledge is needed by agents in order to coordinate successfully. If the answer is unbounded knowledge, then a whole variety of paradoxes arise. If the answer is very little knowledge, then there seems hardly any possibility of attaining coordination. The solution to coordination and cooperation is for agents to learn about each other. The author concludes that rationality must be supplemented by models of learning and by an evolutionary account of how social order (i.e. spontaneous coordinated behaviour) can persist.","author":[{"family":"Bicchieri","given":"Cristina"}],"citation-key":"bicchieri1993rationality","ISBN":"978-0-521-57444-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"294","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Rationality and Coordination","type":"book"},{"id":"bickel_mathematical_2000","author":[{"family":"Bickel","given":"P.J."},{"family":"Doksum","given":"K.A."}],"citation-key":"bickel_mathematical_2000","edition":"2","event-place":"Upper Saddle River, NJ","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Prentice-Hall","publisher-place":"Upper Saddle River, NJ","title":"Mathematical statistics: Basic ideas and selected Topics","type":"book","volume":"1"},{"id":"binladen2005messages","abstract":"Despite the saturation of global media coverage, Osama bin Laden's own writings have been curiously absent from analysis of the \"war on terror.\" Over the last ten years, bin Laden has issued a series of carefully tailored public statements, from interviews with Western and Arabic journalists to faxes and video recordings. These texts supply evidence crucial to an understanding of the bizarre mix of Quranic scholarship, CIA training, punctual interventions in Gulf politics and messianic anti-imperialism that has formed the programmatic core of Al Qaeda.In bringing together the various statements issued under bin Laden's name since 1994, this volume forms part of a growing discourse that seeks to demythologize the terrorist network. Newly translated from the Arabic, annotated with a critical introduction by Islamic scholar Bruce Lawrence, this collection places the statements in their religious, historical and political context. It shows how bin Laden's views draw on and differ from other strands of radical Islamic thought; it also demonstrates how his arguments vary in degrees of consistency, and how his evasions concerning the true nature and extent of his own group, and over his own role in terrorist attacks, have contributed to the perpetuation of his personal mythology.","author":[{"family":"Laden","given":"Osama","non-dropping-particle":"bin"}],"citation-key":"binladen2005messages","ISBN":"978-1-78960-306-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"428","publisher":"Verso Books","source":"Google Books","title":"Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama Bin Laden","title-short":"Messages to the World","type":"book"},{"id":"birch2021english","abstract":"English L2 Reading: Getting to the Bottom uses research-based insights to examine bottom-up skills in reading English as a second language.

This paper develops a method to uncover the values consistent with observed allocation decisions. We use machine learning methods to estimate how much each individual benefits from an intervention, and then reconcile its allocation with (i) the welfare weights assigned to different people; (ii) heterogeneous treatment effects of the intervention; and (iii) weights on different outcomes. We demonstrate this approach by analyzing Mexico's PROGRESA anti-poverty program. The analysis reveals that while the program prioritized certain subgroups -- such as indigenous households -- the fact that those groups benefited more implies that they were in fact assigned a lower welfare weight. The PROGRESA case illustrates how the method makes it possible to audit existing policies, and to design future policies that better align with values.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Björkegren","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Blumenstock","given":"Joshua E."},{"family":"Knight","given":"Samsun"}],"citation-key":"bjorkegren2022machine","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2206.00727","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,1]]},"number":"arXiv:2206.00727","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"(Machine) Learning What Policies Value","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00727"},{"id":"black_pricing_1973","author":[{"family":"Black","given":"F."},{"family":"Scholes","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"black_pricing_1973","container-title":"Journal of Political Economy","issued":{"date-parts":[["1973"]]},"language":"en","page":"637-654","title":"The pricing of options and corporate liabilities","type":"article-journal","volume":"81"},{"id":"blackstone1769commentaries","abstract":"Sir William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765-1769) stands as the first great effort to reduce the English common law to a unified and rational system. Blackstone demonstrated that the English law as a system of justice was comparable to Roman law and the civil law of the Continent. Clearly and elegantly written, the work achieved immediate renown and exerted a powerful influence on legal education in England and in America which was to last into the late nineteenth century. The book is regarded not only as a legal classic but as a literary masterpiece.  Previously available only in an expensive hardcover set, Commentaries on the Laws of England is published here in four separate volumes, each one affordably priced in a paperback edition. These works are facsimiles of the eighteenth-century first edition and are undistorted by later interpolations. Each volume deals with a particular field of law and carries with it an introduction by a leading contemporary scholar.  Introducing this second volume, Of the Rights of Things, A. W.

For Muslim texts, we identify an inflection point in political discourse between the eleventh to thirteenth centuries, a juncture that historians suggest is an ideational watershed brought about by the Turkic and Mongol invaders.

This thesis argues that the traditional conception of political liberty in the negative sense – freedom from interference – is insufficient as an explanation, and political liberty should instead be conceived of as freedom from domination, as espoused by republican thinkers, especially Philip Pettit. However, it is further argued that non-domination requires additional conceptual and practical support, by the republicans’ own logic, than has traditionally been extended. Most critically, a critique is advanced based on the additions of alienation and structural domination as key republican concepts. This critique argues that corporate power, and the concentration of economic power in the hands of a few, drastically undermines republican freedom, and must be combated via regulation and economic reform, which the thesis refers to as “strict material equality”, in contrast to Pettit’s “loose material equality” and “expressive egalitarianism”. The form this regulation and reform might take is considered in detail before the thesis presents a potential solution based on a form of democratic socialism which makes use of social recognition, socialisation, and controlled voluntary exchange in the model Joseph Carens presents in his book “Equality, Moral Incentives, and the Market”. The remainder of the thesis is devoted to explicating and defending a republican take on his “egalitarian system”, and defending his socialisation process, explicit utopianism, and the socialist elements which the thesis invokes to explain problems of alienation and corporate power.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Blenkinsop","given":"Thomas S."}],"citation-key":"blenkinsop2020what","genre":"Ph.D.","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"eng","note":"Accepted: 2020","publisher":"University of Bristol","source":"ethos.bl.uk","title":"What safeguards are necessary to guarantee political liberty as non-domination?","type":"thesis","URL":"https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/3003c752-7484-4171-a0a7-a1b6c60abb91"},{"id":"bloch2016centrality","abstract":"We show that prominent centrality measures in network analysis are all based on additively separable and linear treatments of statistics that capture a node's position in the network.

We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female.  Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bolukbasi","given":"Tolga"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Kai-Wei"},{"family":"Zou","given":"James Y"},{"family":"Saligrama","given":"Venkatesh"},{"family":"Kalai","given":"Adam T"}],"citation-key":"bolukbasi2016man","container-title":"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"publisher":"Curran Associates, Inc.","source":"Neural Information Processing Systems","title":"Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker?

All are examples of classification—the scaffolding of information infrastructures.In Sorting Things Out, Geoffrey C. Bowker and Susan Leigh Star explore the role of categories and standards in shaping the modern world. In a clear and lively style, they investigate a variety of classification systems, including the International Classification of Diseases, the Nursing Interventions Classification, race classification under apartheid in South Africa, and the classification of viruses and of tuberculosis.The authors emphasize the role of invisibility in the process by which classification orders human interaction. They examine how categories are made and kept invisible, and how people can change this invisibility when necessary. They also explore systems of classification as part of the built information environment. Much as an urban historian would review highway permits and zoning decisions to tell a city's story, the authors review archives of classification design to understand how decisions have been made. Sorting Things Out has a moral agenda, for each standard and category valorizes some point of view and silences another. Standards and classifications produce advantage or suffering. Jobs are made and lost; some regions benefit at the expense of others. How these choices are made and how we think about that process are at the moral and political core of this work. The book is an important empirical source for understanding the building of information infrastructures.","author":[{"family":"Bowker","given":"Geoffrey C."},{"family":"Star","given":"Susan Leigh"}],"citation-key":"bowker2000sorting","ISBN":"978-0-262-26160-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",8,25]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"396","publisher":"MIT Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences","title-short":"Sorting Things Out","type":"book"},{"id":"bowles1992power","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Bowles","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Gintis","given":"Herbert"}],"citation-key":"bowles1992power","container-title":"Philosophy & Public Affairs","ISSN":"0048-3915","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]},"page":"324-353","publisher":"Wiley","source":"JSTOR","title":"Power and Wealth in a Competitive Capitalist Economy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2265369","volume":"21"},{"id":"bowles1993revenge","abstract":"Recent developments in microeconomic theory have shown that the self-interested behavior underlying neoclassical theory is artificially truncated: it depicts a charmingly Victorian but Utopian world in which conflicts abound but a handshake is a handshake. But a handshake is not always a handshake. Studies of principal-agent analysis, the economics of information, radical political economy, mechanism design, and transactions cost economics have all focused on the difficulties involved in policing and enforcing the actual process of market exchange. Abandoning the Victorian world of neoclassical theory will redirect economists to an older conception of their profession: what once was called political economy. By taking optimizing more seriously, post-Walrasian economics has inspired a revolution in economic thought fostering both new theoretical departures and alternative conceptions of the capitalist economy. We will offer our own interpretation of this literature, focusing on the widely recognized fact that the terms arising from exchange are not generally enforceable at zero cost to the exchanging parties. Where some aspect of the good or service supplied is both valuable to the buyer and costly to provide, the absence of third-party enforcement of claims gives rise to endogenous enforcement strategies. We refer to this relationship as a \"contested exchange\" because, unlike the transactions of Walrasian economics, the benefit the parties derive from the transaction depends on their own capacities to enforce competing claims.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bowles","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Gintis","given":"Herbert"}],"citation-key":"bowles1993revenge","container-title":"Journal of Economic Perspectives","DOI":"10.1257/jep.7.1.83","ISSN":"0895-3309","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",3]]},"language":"en","page":"83-102","source":"www.aeaweb.org","title":"The Revenge of Homo Economicus: Contested Exchange and the Revival of Political Economy","title-short":"The Revenge of Homo Economicus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.7.1.83","volume":"7"},{"id":"bowles1998power","abstract":"Introduction In the standard Walrasian model of general economic equilibrium, competitively determined allocations maximize each agent’s utility subject to that agent’s wealth constraint, and prices simultaneously eliminate excess demand or supply in all markets.

Using recent advances in evolutionary game theory, contract theory, behavioral experiments, and the modeling of dynamic processes, he develops a theory of how economic institutions shape individual behavior, and how institutions evolve due to individual actions, technological change, and chance events. Topics addressed include institutional innovation, social preferences, nonmarket social interactions, social capital, equilibrium unemployment, credit constraints, economic power, generalized increasing returns, disequilibrium outcomes, and path dependency. Each chapter is introduced by empirical puzzles or historical episodes illuminated by the modeling that follows, and the book closes with sets of problems to be solved by readers seeking to improve their mathematical modeling skills. Complementing standard mathematical analysis are agent-based computer simulations of complex evolving systems that are available online so that readers can experiment with the models. Bowles concludes with the time-honored challenge of \"getting the rules right,\" providing an evaluation of markets, states, and communities as contrasting and yet sometimes synergistic structures of governance. Must reading for students and scholars not only in economics but across the behavioral sciences, this engagingly written and compelling exposition of the new microeconomics moves the field beyond the conventional models of prices and markets toward a more accurate and policy-relevant portrayal of human social behavior.","author":[{"family":"Bowles","given":"Samuel"}],"citation-key":"bowles2009microeconomics","ISBN":"978-1-4008-2931-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12,13]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"599","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution","title-short":"Microeconomics","type":"book"},{"id":"bowles2016moral","abstract":"Should the idea of economic man—the amoral and self-interested Homo economicus—determine how we expect people to respond to monetary rewards, punishments, and other incentives?

Sixteen states came to be ruled by communist parties during the 20th century. One, the Soviet Union, was geographically the largest nation in the world and a superpower. Another, China, had the world's largest population. At communism's high point, its adherents envisioned global triumph. Today, however, only five communist regimes remain in power. Why? In The Rise and Demise of World Communism, George Breslauer, a specialist who has spent decades observing the evolution of communist states, provides a sweeping history of the world communist movement, focusing in particular on what communist states shared in common and why they began to differ from each other over time. Throughout, Breslauer explores the relations among communist states as well as the relations between those states and the world of increasingly affluent, and militarily formidable, democratic-capitalist powers. He finds that these regimes all came to power in the context of warfare or its aftermath, followed by the consolidation of power by a revolutionary elite that valued \"revolutionary violence\" as the preferred means to an end, based upon Marx's vision of apocalyptic revolution and Lenin's conception of party organization. As Breslauer shows, all these regimes went on to \"build socialism\" according to a Stalinist template and were initially dedicated to \"anti-imperialist struggle\" as members of a world communist movement. But their common features gave way to diversity, difference, and defiance after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953. For many reasons, and in many ways, those differences soon blew apart the world communist movement and eventually led to the collapse of European communism. Even though a few communist regimes still remain in power, the dream of world communism is dead. But the future of the remaining communist regimes is uncertain. An accessible history of one of the most important political phenomena of the past 150 years, The Rise and Demise of World Communism provides readers with a crisp account of the entire movement--from the theories of Marx and Lenin to the on-the-ground policies of Stalin, Mao, Gorbachev, Deng, and other communist leaders-that culminates in our own era.","author":[{"family":"Breslauer","given":"George W."}],"citation-key":"breslauer2021rise","ISBN":"978-0-19-757969-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,4]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"507","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Rise and Demise of World Communism","type":"book"},{"id":"brobjer_nietzsche_2010","abstract":"Friedrich Nietzsche was immensely influential and, counter to most expectations, also very well read.

A multilevel analysis shows that Muslim Brotherhood branches were more likely in subdistricts connected to the railway and where literacy was higher. Branches were less likely in districts with large European populations, and where state administration was more extensive. Qualitative evidence also points to the railway as key to the movement’s propagation.

Brudney focuses on the transmutations of a set of ideas about human nature, the good life, and our relation to the world and to others; about how we end up with false beliefs about these matters; about whether one can, in a capitalist society, know the truth about these matters; and about the critique of capitalism which would flow from such knowledge.  Brudney shows how Marx, following Feuerbach, attempted to reveal humanity's nature and what would count as the good life, while eschewing and indeed polemicizing against \"philosophy\"--against any concern with metaphysics and epistemology. Marx attempted to avoid philosophy as early as 1844, and the central aims of his texts are the same right through The German Ideology. There is thus no break between an early and a late Marx; moreover, there is no \"materialist\" Marx, no Marx who subscribes to a metaphysical view, even in The German Ideology, the text canonically taken as the origin of Marxist materialism. Rather, in all the texts of this period Marx tries to mount a compelling critique of the present while altogether avoiding the dilemmas central to philosophy in the modern era.Table of Contents:  Abbreviations  Introduction Themes from the Young Hegelians Feuerbach's and Marx's Complaint against Philosophy The Interest of These Texts Chapter by Chapter  1.

The discussions of Bruno Bauer and Marx's writings of 1844-6, in particular, are valuable resources for students of German philosophy of the 1840s.\" DD--Brian Leiter, Times Literary Supplement\"Brudney's work offers some fascinating insights into the world of the Young Hegelians from whence Marx came. It also makes some subtle points about the epistemology of moral theory and about the communitarian aspects of Marx's vision that are important for contemporary philosophy.\" DD--R.

Two core components—the claim that workers have “no reasonable alternative” to selling their labor to capitalists and the relevance of exposure to potential interference in such cases—remain unclear. Without a more precise specification of the conditions of structural domination, it is difficult to assess how well republican prescriptions minimize it. I develop a revised defense of the central claim through an analysis of these components. I clarify what it is to have reasonable alternatives in the labor market but show that holding such options is insufficient to avoid structural domination. I argue that the dependence at the heart of structural domination can be constituted multifariously and develop an additional criterion directed at capturing such dependence in production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Bryan","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"bryan2022structural","container-title":"American Political Science Review","DOI":"10.1017/S0003055422000922","ISSN":"0003-0554, 1537-5943","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,13]]},"language":"en","page":"1-13","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Structural Domination and Freedom in the Labor Market: From Voluntariness to Independence","title-short":"Structural Domination and Freedom in the Labor Market","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/structural-domination-and-freedom-in-the-labor-market-from-voluntariness-to-independence/15DE09962D69039C60D94AE163381C72"},{"id":"buick1980socialist","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Buick","given":"Adam"}],"citation-key":"buick1980socialist","container-title":"Socialist Standard","issue":"908","issued":{"date-parts":[["1980"]]},"page":"1-3","title":"Socialist Standard Past & Present: A new translation of Marx's `Capital' (1980)","title-short":"Socialist Standard Past & Present","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://socialiststandardmyspace.blogspot.com/2016/08/a-new-translation-of-marxs-capital-1980.html"},{"id":"buringh2009charting","abstract":"This article estimates the development of manuscripts and printed books in Western Europe over the course of thirteen centuries.

Krueger have already made national news with their pathbreaking research on the minimum wage. Here they present a powerful new challenge to the conventional view that higher minimum wages reduce jobs for low-wage workers. In a work that has important implications for public policy as well as for the direction of economic research, the authors put standard economic theory to the test, using data from a series of recent episodes, including the 1992 increase in New Jersey's minimum wage, the 1988 rise in California's minimum wage, and the 1990-91 increases in the federal minimum wage. In each case they present a battery of evidence showing that increases in the minimum wage lead to increases in pay, but no loss in jobs.  A distinctive feature of Card and Krueger's research is the use of empirical methods borrowed from the natural sciences, including comparisons between the \"treatment\" and \"control\" groups formed when the minimum wage rises for some workers but not for others. In addition, the authors critically reexamine the previous literature on the minimum wage and find that it, too, lacks support for the claim that a higher minimum wage cuts jobs. Finally, the effects of the minimum wage on family earnings, poverty outcomes, and the stock market valuation of low-wage employers are documented. Overall, this book calls into question the standard model of the labor market that has dominated economists' thinking on the minimum wage. In addition, it will shift the terms of the debate on the minimum wage in Washington and in state legislatures throughout the country.","author":[{"family":"Card","given":"David Edward"},{"family":"Krueger","given":"Alan B."}],"citation-key":"card1995myth","ISBN":"978-0-691-04390-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"422","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage","title-short":"Myth and Measurement","type":"book"},{"id":"card2018firms","abstract":"We synthesize two related literatures on firm-level drivers of wage inequality.

It takes a thematic approach in three substantial chapters: Imagination, Observation, and Vocation. Throughout, the reader sees the world from Engels’s perspective, not knowing how his story will turn out. This approach reveals the multifaceted and ambitious character of young Friedrich’s achievements from age sixteen till just turning twenty-five. At the time that he accepted Marx’s invitation to co-author a short political satire, Engels was far better known and much more accomplished. He had published many more articles on far more subjects, in both German and English, than Marx had managed. Moreover, he had written a critique of political economy from a perspective unique in the German context, and published his own pioneering and substantial study of working class conditions in an industrializing economy. Offering an innovative approach to a largely neglected period of Engels’s life before meeting Marx, Carver upends standard narratives in existing biographical studies of Engels to reveal him as an important figure not just in relation to his more famous collaborator, but a key voice in the liberal-democratic, constitutional and nation-building revolutionism of the 1830s and 1840s.","author":[{"family":"Carver","given":"Terrell"}],"citation-key":"carver2020engels","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-3-030-42371-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,15]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"120","publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Google Books","title":"Engels before Marx","type":"book"},{"id":"casella_statistical_2002","author":[{"family":"Casella","given":"G."},{"family":"Berger","given":"R.L."}],"citation-key":"casella_statistical_2002","edition":"2nd","event-place":"Pacific Grove, CA","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Brooks/Cole","publisher-place":"Pacific Grove, CA","title":"Statistical inference","type":"book"},{"id":"castells2007communication","abstract":"This article presents a set of grounded hypotheses on the relationship between communication and power relationships in the technological context that characterizes the network society.

It shows the direct link between politics, media politics, the politics of scandal, and the crisis of political legitimacy in a global perspective. It also puts forward the notion that the development of interactive, horizontal networks of communication has induced the rise of a new form of communication, mass self-communication, over the Internet and wireless communication networks. Under these conditions, insurgent politics and social movements are able to intervene more decisively in the new communication space. However, corporate media and mainstream politics have also invested in this new communication space. As a result of these processes, mass media and horizontal communication networks are converging.

He illuminates the repressive regime's complex economy and culture, its appalling record of human-rights abuses, and its belligerent relationship with the United States, and analyzes the regime's major security issues—from the seemingly endless war with its southern neighbor to its frightening nuclear ambitions—all in light of the destabilizing effects of Kim Jong-il's recent death.How this enigmatic nation-state—one that regularly violates its own citizens' inalienable rights and has suffered famine, global economic sanctions, a collapsed economy, and near total isolation from the rest of the world—has continued to survive has long been a question that preoccupies the West. Cha reveals a land of contradictions, one facing a pivotal and disquieting transition of power from tyrannical father to inexperienced son, and delves into the ideology that leads an oppressed, starving populace to cling so fiercely to its failed leadership.With rare personal anecdotes from the author's time in Pyongyang and his tenure as an adviser in the White House, this engagingly written, authoritative, and highly accessible history offers much-needed answers to the most pressing questions about North Korea and ultimately warns of a regime that might be closer to its end than many might think—a political collapse for which America and its allies may be woefully unprepared.","author":[{"family":"Cha","given":"Victor"}],"citation-key":"cha2012impossible","ISBN":"978-0-06-220015-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",4,3]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"491","publisher":"Harper Collins","source":"Google Books","title":"The Impossible State: North Korea, Past and Future","title-short":"The Impossible State","type":"book"},{"id":"chalkidis2017deep","author":[{"family":"Chalkidis","given":"Ilias"}],"citation-key":"chalkidis2017deep","DOI":"10.3233/978-1-61499-838-9-155","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"155-164","title":"A Deep Learning Approach to Contract Element Extraction.","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"chalkidis2017extracting","abstract":"We study how contract element extraction can be automated.

In The Global Offensive, historian Paul Thomas Chamberlin offers new insights into the rise of the Palestine Liberation Organization in its full international context. After defeat in the 1967 war, the crushing of a guerrilla campaign on the West Bank, and the attack on al-Karama, Arafat and his fellow guerilla fighters opened a global offensive aimed at achieving national liberation for the Palestinian people. In doing so, they reinvented themselves as players on the world stage, combining controversial armed attacks, diplomacy, and radical politics. They forged a network of nationalist revolutionaries, making alliances with South African rebels, Latin American insurrectionists, and Vietnamese Communists. They persuaded the United Nations to take up their agenda, and sent Americans and Soviets scrambling as these stateless forces drew new connections across the globe. \"The Vietnamese and Palestinian people have much in common,\" General Vo Nguyen Giap would tell Arafat, \"just like two people suffering from the same illness.\" Richard Nixon's views mirrored Giap's: \"You cannot separate what happens to America in Vietnam from the Mideast or from Europe or any place else.\" Deftly argued and based on extensive new research, The Global Offensive will change the way we think of the history of not only the PLO, but also the Cold War and international relations since.","author":[{"family":"Chamberlin","given":"Paul Thomas"}],"citation-key":"chamberlin2012global","ISBN":"978-0-19-981146-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",9,7]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"337","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Global Offensive: The United States, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the Making of the Post-Cold War Order","title-short":"The Global Offensive","type":"book"},{"id":"chang2020divergence","author":[{"family":"Chang","given":"Kent K."},{"family":"DeDeo","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"chang2020divergence","container-title":"Journal of Cultural Analytics","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"1–36","source":"Google Scholar","title":"Divergence and the Complexity of Difference in Text and Culture","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},{"id":"chartier1981cultural","abstract":"Reknowned historian Roger Chartier, one of the most brilliant and productive of the younger generation of French writers and scholars now at work refashioning the Annales tradition, attempts in this book to analyze the causes of the French revolution not simply by investigating its “cultural origins” but by pinpointing the conditions that “made is possible because conceivable.”Chartier has set himself two important tasks. First, while acknowledging the seminal contribution of Daniel Mornet’s Les origens intellectuelles de la Révolution française (1935), he synthesizes the half-century of scholarship that has created a sociology of culture for Revolutionary France, from education reform through widely circulated printed literature to popular expectations of government and society. Chartier goes beyond Mornet’s work, not be revising that classic text but by raising questions that would not have occurred to its author.Chartier’s second contribution is to reexamine the conventional wisdom that there is a necessary link between the profound cultural transformation of the eighteenth century (generally characterized as the Enlightenment) and the abrupt Revolutionary rupture of 1789.

We depart from the classical setting by allowing for η0 to be so high‐dimensional that the traditional assumptions (e.g. Donsker properties) that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate η0, we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods, which are particularly well suited to estimation in modern, very high‐dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating η0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of θ0 that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of η0 into estimating equations for θ0. This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N−1/2 consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest θ0 can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman‐orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate θ0; (2) making use of cross‐fitting, which provides an efficient form of data‐splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in an N−1/2‐neighbourhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements, which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters, such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of the following: DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model; DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model; DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness; DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Chernozhukov","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Chetverikov","given":"Denis"},{"family":"Demirer","given":"Mert"},{"family":"Duflo","given":"Esther"},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Newey","given":"Whitney"},{"family":"Robins","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"chernozhukov2018double","container-title":"The Econometrics Journal","container-title-short":"The Econometrics Journal","DOI":"10.1111/ectj.12097","ISSN":"1368-4221","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,1]]},"page":"C1-C68","source":"Silverchair","title":"Double/debiased machine learning for treatment and structural parameters","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ectj.12097","volume":"21"},{"id":"chi2020finding","abstract":"Recent work has found evidence that Multilingual BERT (mBERT), a transformer-based multilingual masked language model, is capable of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, suggesting that some aspects of its representations are shared cross-lingually.

Thus, liberal (conservative) interest groups will make campaign contributions to liberal (conservative, respectively) politicians.

Originally written during the mid-1980s, the seminal essay “Pacifism as Pathology” was prompted by veteran activist Ward Churchill’s frustration with what he diagnosed as a growing—and deliberately self-neutralizing—”hegemony of nonviolence” on the North American left. The essay’s publication unleashed a raging debate among activists in both the U.S. and Canada, a significant result of which was Michael Ryan’s penning of a follow-up essay reinforcing Churchill’s premise that nonviolence, at least as the term is popularly employed by white “progressives,” is inherently counterrevolutionary, adding up to little more than a manifestation of its proponents’ desire to maintain their relatively high degrees of socioeconomic privilege and thereby serving to stabilize rather than transform the prevailing relations of power. This short book challenges the pacifist movement’s heralded victories—Gandhi in India, 1960s antiwar activists, even Martin Luther King Jr.’s civil rights movement—suggesting that their success was in spite of, rather than because of, their nonviolent tactics. Churchill also examines the Jewish Holocaust, pointing out that the overwhelming response of Jews was nonviolent, but that when they did use violence they succeeded in inflicting significant damage to the nazi war machine and saving countless lives. As relevant today as when they first appeared, Churchill’s and Ryan’s trailblazing efforts were first published together in book form in 1998. Now, along with the preface to that volume by former participant in armed struggle/political prisoner Ed Mead, postscripts by both Churchill and Ryan, and a powerful new foreword by leading oppositionist intellectual Dylan Rodríguez, these vitally important essays are being released in a fresh edition.","author":[{"family":"Churchill","given":"Ward"},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"churchill1998pacifism","ISBN":"978-1-62963-329-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"204","publisher":"PM Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Pacifism as Pathology: Reflections on the Role of Armed Struggle in North America","title-short":"Pacifism as Pathology","type":"book"},{"id":"cicerchia2022structural","abstract":"In recent years, there has been a wide-ranging debate about the neo-republican principle of non-domination.

Critics of neo-republicanism argue that this definition of freedom as non-domination precludes a structural analysis of domination, which would explain and critique the ways in which societies produce structural domination unintentionally. The article focuses on capitalism?s labor process and its labor markets. It argues that critics are correct to think that the neo-republican principle of non-domination has an insufficient scope, but that an alternative account of structural domination should still support the neo-republican idea that agency must be involved. Otherwise, we might simply fail to explain the social processes that reproduce structural domination. What is needed is to explain how the labor process creates incentives for agents to intentionally produce structures that have unintended, yet dominating effects, and in turn, how the intentions of agents are conditioned by their social positions.

Structuralist, post-structuralist, deconstructed Marxes bloomed in journals and seminar rooms across the US and Europe. These Marxes and their interpreters struggled to interpret the world, and sometimes to interpret Marx himself, losing sight at times of his dictum that the challenge is not to interpret the world but to change it. In 1979, Harry Cleaver tossed an incendiary device called Reading Capital Politically into those seminar rooms. Through a close reading of the first chapter, he shows that Das Kapital was written for the workers, not for academics, and that we need to expand our idea of workers to include housewives, students, the unemployed, and other non-waged workers. Reading Capital Politically provides a theoretical and historical bridge between struggles in Europe in the 60s and 70s and, particularly, the Autonomia of Italy to the Zapatistas of the 90s.

This 'revisionist' analysis of the French Revolution caused a furore on first publication in 1964, challenging as it did established orthodoxies during the crucial period of the Cold War. Cobban saw the French Revolution as central to the 'grand narrative of modern history', but provided a salutary corrective to many celebrated social explanations, determinist and otherwise, of its origins and development. A generation later this concise but powerful intervention was reissued in this 1999 edition with an introduction by Gwynne Lewis, providing students with both a context for Cobban's own arguments, and assessing the course of Revolutionary studies in the wake of The Social Interpretation. This book remains a handbook of revisionism for Anglo-Saxon scholars, and is essential reading for all students of French history at undergraduate level and above.","author":[{"family":"Cobban","given":"Alfred"}],"citation-key":"cobban1964social","ISBN":"978-0-521-66767-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1964"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"232","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Social Interpretation of the French Revolution","type":"book"},{"id":"coffee2020radical","author":[{"family":"Coffee","given":"Alan"}],"citation-key":"coffee2020radical","container-title":"Radical Republicanism: Recovering the Tradition's Popular Heritage","editor":[{"family":"Leipold","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Nabulsi","given":"Karma"},{"family":"White","given":"Stuart"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,1]]},"language":"English","page":"47","publisher":"Oxford Univerity Press; Oxford","title":"A Radical Revolution in Thought: Frederick Douglass on the Slave’s Perspective on Republican Freedom","type":"chapter"},{"id":"cogniot1939ce","author":[{"family":"Cogniot","given":"Georges"}],"citation-key":"cogniot1939ce","issued":{"date-parts":[["1939"]]},"publisher":"La Brochure Populaire, no. 9","title":"Ce que nous enseigne 'l’Histoire du parti bolchévik'","type":"document"},{"id":"cohen1978karl","abstract":"First published in 1978, this book rapidly established itself as a classic of modern Marxism.

However, the history of military translation in the US occupation of Iraq suggests that this model is inadequate on a number of accounts, including the ways in which translation theory privileges literary translation over other translational activities. This essay surveys the development of Arabic–English translation within US military strategic thinking and the adjunct role played by militarised interpreters in the US occupation of Iraq. It then considers Arabic–English translation in terms of the lives of translators, as opposed to the textual products produced by their labour. It concludes by sketching the nineteenth-century history of the Levantine dragoman in order to draw resemblances with more recent histories of military translation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Colla","given":"Elliott"}],"citation-key":"colla2015dragomen","container-title":"The Translator","DOI":"10.1080/13556509.2015.1071523","ISSN":"1355-6509","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,4]]},"page":"132-153","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Dragomen and checkpoints","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13556509.2015.1071523","volume":"21"},{"id":"collingwood1946idea","author":[{"family":"Collingwood","given":"R.

MacPherson PrizeStudies in Political Economy Book Prize Over the past forty years, recognition has become the dominant mode of negotiation and decolonization between the nation-state and Indigenous nations in North America. The term “recognition” shapes debates over Indigenous cultural distinctiveness, Indigenous rights to land and self-government, and Indigenous peoples’ right to benefit from the development of their lands and resources. In a work of critically engaged political theory, Glen Sean Coulthard challenges recognition as a method of organizing difference and identity in liberal politics, questioning the assumption that contemporary difference and past histories of destructive colonialism between the state and Indigenous peoples can be reconciled through a process of acknowledgment. Beyond this, Coulthard examines an alternative politics—one that seeks to revalue, reconstruct, and redeploy Indigenous cultural practices based on self-recognition rather than on seeking appreciation from the very agents of colonialism. Coulthard demonstrates how a “place-based” modification of Karl Marx’s theory of “primitive accumulation” throws light on Indigenous–state relations in settler-colonial contexts and how Frantz Fanon’s critique of colonial recognition shows that this relationship reproduces itself over time. This framework strengthens his exploration of the ways that the politics of recognition has come to serve the interests of settler-colonial power. In addressing the core tenets of Indigenous resistance movements, like Red Power and Idle No More, Coulthard offers fresh insights into the politics of active decolonization.","author":[{"family":"Coulthard","given":"Glen Sean"}],"citation-key":"coulthard2014red","ISBN":"978-1-4529-4243-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",8,15]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"319","publisher":"University of Minnesota Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Red Skin, White Masks: Rejecting the Colonial Politics of Recognition","title-short":"Red Skin, White Masks","type":"book"},{"id":"cowan1983more","abstract":"This book has a dual focus.

From this definition is developed a statement of power comparability, or the relative degree of power held by two or more persons.

The hypothesis claims that there is an intrinsic interconnection between thought, language, and society. All technical terms are explained and a glossary is provided at the back of the volume. The book looks at the history and different versions of the hypothesis over the centuries, including the research paradigms and critiques that it has generated. It also describes and analyzes the relevant research designed to test its validity in various domains of language structure and use, from grammar and discourse to artificial languages and in nonverbal semiotic systems as well. Overall, this book aims to present a comprehensive overview of the hypothesis and its supporting research in a textbook fashion, with pedagogical activities in each chapter, including questions for discussion and practical exercises on specific notions associated with the hypothesis. The book also discusses the hypothesis as a foundational notion for the establishment of linguistic anthropology as a major branch of linguistics. This essential course text inspires creative, informed dialogue and debate for students of anthropology,linguistics, cultural studies, cognitive science, and psychology.","author":[{"family":"Danesi","given":"Marcel"}],"citation-key":"danesi2021linguistic","ISBN":"978-1-00-031816-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,15]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"155","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Google Books","title":"Linguistic Relativity Today: Language, Mind, Society, and the Foundations of Linguistic Anthropology","title-short":"Linguistic Relativity Today","type":"book"},{"id":"dannreuther2016soviet","abstract":"The Soviet Union and the PLO provides a comprehensive account of Soviet-PLO relations from the formation of the PLO in 1964 to the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 199.

Darnton's history of the Encyclopedie is such an occasion. The author explores some fascinating territory in the French genre of histoire du livre, and at the same time he tracks the diffusion of Enlightenment ideas. He is concerned with the form of the thought of the great philosophes as it materialized into books and with the way books were made and distributed in the business of publishing. This is cultural history on a broad scale, a history of the process of civilization. In tracing the publishing story of Diderot's Encyclopedie, Darnton uses new sources--the papers of eighteenth-century publishers--that allow him to respond firmly to a set of problems long vexing historians. He shows how the material basis of literature and the technology of its production affected the substance and diffusion of ideas. He fully explores the workings of the literary market place, including the roles of publishers, book dealers, traveling salesmen, and other intermediaries in cultural communication. How publishing functioned as a business, and how it fit into the political as well as the economic systems of prerevolutionary Europe are set forth. The making of books touched on this vast range of activities because books were products of artisanal labor, objects of economic exchange, vehicles of ideas, and elements in political and religious conflict. The ways ideas traveled in early modern Europe, the level of penetration of Enlightenment ideas in the society of the Old Regime, and the connections between the Enlightenment and the French Revolution are brilliantly treated by Darnton. In doing so he unearths a double paradox. It was the upper orders in society rather than the industrial bourgeoisie or the lower classes that first shook off archaic beliefs and took up Enlightenment ideas. And the state, which initially had suppressed those ideas, ultimately came to favor them. Yet at this high point in the diffusion and legitimation of the Enlightenment, the French Revolution erupted, destroying the social and political order in which the Enlightenment had flourished. Never again will the contours of the Enlightenment be drawn without reference to this work. Darnton has written an indispensable book for historians of modern Europe.","author":[{"family":"Darnton","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"darnton1979business","ISBN":"978-0-674-03018-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1979"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"639","publisher":"Harvard University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Business of Enlightenment: a publishing history of the Encyclopédie, 1775-1800","title-short":"The Business of Enlightenment","type":"book"},{"id":"darnton1989revolution","abstract":"Explains the role of printing in the French Revolution and the establishment of the revolutionary government","author":[{"family":"Darnton","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Roche","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Library","given":"New York Public"}],"citation-key":"darnton1989revolution","ISBN":"978-0-520-06431-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1989",1,1]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"388","publisher":"University of California Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Revolution in Print: The Press in France, 1775-1800","title-short":"Revolution in Print","type":"book"},{"id":"darnton2014censors","author":[{"family":"Darnton","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"darnton2014censors","event-place":"New York, NY","ISBN":"978-0-393-24229-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"publisher":"W.W.

In a series of searching, propulsive essays, Davis, the bestselling author of City of Quartz and recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship, explores Marx’s inquiries into two key questions of our time: Who can lead a revolutionary transformation of society? And what is the cause—and solution—of the planetary environmental crisis?Davis consults a vast archive of labor history to illuminate new aspects of Marx’s theoretical texts and political journalism. He offers a “lost Marx,” whose analyses of historical agency, nationalism, and the “middle landscape” of class struggle are crucial to the renewal of revolutionary thought in our darkening age. Davis presents a critique of the current fetishism of the “anthropocene,” which suppresses the links between the global employment crisis and capitalism’s failure to ensure human survival in a more extreme climate.

The ease with which such pieces of folk wisdom translate across both time and species suggests that there is a general, and even perhaps universal, logic to hierarchies and how they form. Kawakatsu et al. (1) make an important advance in the quest for this kind of understanding, providing a general model for how subtle differences in individual-level decision-making can lead to hard-to-miss consequences for society as a whole.\n\nTheir work (1) reveals two distinct regimes—one egalitarian, one hierarchical—that emerge from shifts in individual-level judgment. These lead to statistical methods that researchers can use to reverse engineer observed hierarchies, and understand how signaling systems work when prestige and power are in play. The results make a singular contribution at the intersection of two distinct traditions of research into social power: the mechanistic (how hierarchies get made) and the functional (the adaptive roles they can play in society).\n\nHierarchies were first understood mechanistically, as pecking orders that were the cumulative consequence of individual aggressive acts (2). Researchers focused on how to translate aggression (e.g., physical harm) or endorsement (e.g., signals of submission) into rank. Ideally, aggression and rank should be consistent. If A ranked above B, one wanted no aggressive acts from B to A, or submissive acts from A to B. Cycles frustrated this goal (A might aggress against B, B against C, and C against A), and so a next step adjusted the final ranks to minimize both the number and the strength of the inconsistencies (3).\n\nThese methods produced holistic assessments: The relative rank of A and B depended, … \n\n[↵][1]1To whom correspondence may be addressed.

The defining feature of this Companion is its attention to the new directions in Marxism that animate the theoretical, scientific, and political sides of Marx's thought. Gender and the growing importance of Marxist-feminism is treated as equally important to clarifying Marx today as traditional and diverse categories of critique such as class, capital, and mode of production. Similarly, this Companion showcases the methodological and political importance of Marxism to environmentalist politics.

It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought.Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.”Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender.

The definition is deceivingly simple; thanks to their many useful properties, they have found applications in psychometrics, crystallography, machine learning, wireless sensor networks, acoustics, and more. Despite the usefulness of EDMs, they seem to be insufficiently known in the signal processing community. Our goal is to rectify this mishap in a concise tutorial. We review the fundamental properties of EDMs, such as rank or (non)definiteness, and show how the various EDM properties can be used to design algorithms for completing and denoising distance data. Along the way, we demonstrate applications to microphone position calibration, ultrasound tomography, room reconstruction from echoes, and phase retrieval. By spelling out the essential algorithms, we hope to fast-track the readers in applying EDMs to their own problems.

The main questions asked are: How did the U.S. become involved in these wars? How were the wars conducted? And how did the U.S. get out of these wars?In Korea and Vietnam, the US fought to show the world that it would stand up to the evils of communism—that it could be counted on (with money, advisors, or even a major military effort if necessary) to halt the advance of communism. But in both wars, the US showed itself to be militarily vulnerable. In its wars against radical Islam since 9/11, the United States has made use of its military to protect its interests in the Middle East, particularly its oil interests, while trying to spread its ideas of democracy, constitutionalism, and the rule of law. The lessons are clear: America's values often do not translate into the less-developed world.In 2016, as the debate over ISIS intensifies, America at War since 1945 reminds us that the history of US postwar military conflict has seldom been marked by clearly defined goals and outcomes.

We replicate the absence of round number discontinuities in firm labor supply in matched worker-firm hourly wage data from Oregon as well as in an online stated preference experiment conducted with Wal-Mart workers. Further, the shape of the missing mass that accounts for the bunching at a round number exhibits none of the asymmetry predicted by worker left-digit bias. Symmetry of the missing mass distribution around the round number suggests that employer optimization frictions are more important. We show that a more monopsonistic market requires less employer mis-optimization to rationalize the bunching in the data. The extent of monopsony power implied by our estimated labor supply elasticities, which are in line with other recent studies, are consistent with a sizable amount of non-optimal bunching, with only modest losses in profits.

We also present an adaptation of our approach to achieve the complementary goal of \"fair affirmative action,\" which guarantees statistical parity (i.e., the demographics of the set of individuals receiving any classification are the same as the demographics of the underlying population), while treating similar individuals as similarly as possible.

In defending their autonomy, federations in the International became aware of what separated them from the social democratic movement that relied on the establishment of national labor parties and the conquest of political power. This can be seen as a decisive moment in the history of political ideas: the split between centralist party politics and the federalist grassroots movement. The separate movements in the International--which would later develop into social democracy, communism, and anarchism--found their greatest advocates in Mikhail Bakunin and Karl Marx. However, the significance of this alleged clash of titans is largely a modern invention. It was not the rivalry between two arch-enemies or a personal vendetta based on mutual resentment that made the conflict between Bakunin and Marx so important but rather that it heralded the first socialist schism between parliamentary party politics aiming to conquer political power and social-revolutionary concepts. Instead of focusing exclusively on what Marx and Bakunin said, many other contributions to this debate are examined, making this the first reconstruction of a dispute that gripped the entire organization. This book also provides the first detailed account of the International's Congress of The Hague (September, 1872); including the background, the sequence of events, and international reaction. The book sets new standards when it comes to source material, taking into account documents from numerous archives and libraries that have previously gone unnoticed or were completely unknown.","author":[{"family":"Eckhardt","given":"Wolfgang"}],"citation-key":"eckhardt2016first","ISBN":"978-1-62963-042-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"603","publisher":"PM Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The First Socialist Schism: Bakunin Vs.

Many scholars consider the commonly used assumption of no omitted confounders to be untenable due to contextual confounding and homophily bias. To address this long-standing problem, we examine the causal identification under a new assumption of structural stationarity, which formalizes the underlying diffusion process with a class of dynamic causal directed acyclic graphs. First, we develop a statistical test that can detect a wide range of biases, including the two types mentioned above. We then propose a difference-in-differences style estimator that can directly correct biases under an additional parametric assumption. Leveraging the proposed methods, we study the spatial diffusion of hate crimes against refugees in Germany. After correcting large upward bias in existing studies, we find hate crimes diffuse only to areas that have a high proportion of school dropouts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Egami","given":"Naoki"}],"citation-key":"egami2020identification","container-title":"arXiv:1810.07858 [stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,26]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Identification of Causal Diffusion Effects Under Structural Stationarity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07858"},{"id":"ehrbar2010annotations","author":[{"family":"Ehrbar","given":"Hans"}],"citation-key":"ehrbar2010annotations","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"publisher":"Marx Annotations Project","title":"Annotations to Karl Marx's Capital","type":"book"},{"id":"ehrbar2010glossary","author":[{"family":"Ehrbar","given":"Hans"}],"citation-key":"ehrbar2010glossary","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"publisher":"Marx Annotations Project","title":"Glossary to Marx's Capital and Other Economic Writings","type":"book","URL":"http://content.csbs.utah.edu/~ehrbar/glossary.pdf"},{"id":"ehrenberg1996proudhon","abstract":"This work concerns the thoughts of Proudhon (1809-1865).

But moving beyond this aggregate relationship has proven difficult, in part because of limited microdata on union membership prior to 1973. We develop a new source of microdata on union membership dating back to 1936, survey data primarily from Gallup (N ≈ 980,000), to examine the long-run relationship between unions and inequality. We document dramatic changes in the demographics of union members: when density was at its mid-century peak, union households were much less educated and more nonwhite than other households, whereas pre-World War II and today they are more similar to nonunion households on these dimensions. However, despite large changes in composition and density since 1936, the household union premium holds relatively steady between 10 and 20 log points. We use our data to examine the effect of unions on income inequality. Using distributional decompositions, time series regressions, state-year regressions, as well as a new instrumental-variable strategy based on the 1935 legalization of unions and the World War II–era War Labor Board, we find consistent evidence that unions reduce inequality, explaining a significant share of the dramatic fall in inequality between the mid-1930s and late 1940s.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Farber","given":"Henry S"},{"family":"Herbst","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Kuziemko","given":"Ilyana"},{"family":"Naidu","given":"Suresh"}],"citation-key":"farber2021unions","container-title":"The Quarterly Journal of Economics","container-title-short":"The Quarterly Journal of Economics","DOI":"10.1093/qje/qjab012","ISSN":"0033-5533","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,1]]},"page":"1325-1385","source":"Silverchair","title":"Unions and Inequality over the Twentieth Century: New Evidence from Survey Data*","title-short":"Unions and Inequality over the Twentieth Century","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjab012","volume":"136"},{"id":"fathi2005wipe","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Fathi","given":"Nazila"}],"citation-key":"fathi2005wipe","container-title":"The New York Times","ISSN":"0362-4331","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",10,27]]},"language":"en-US","section":"World","source":"NYTimes.com","title":"Wipe Israel 'off the map' Iranian says","type":"article-newspaper","URL":"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/27/world/africa/wipe-israel-off-the-map-iranian-says.html"},{"id":"faust1981ideology","abstract":"In one volume, these essentially unabridged selections from the works of the proslavery apologists are now conveniently accessible to scholars and students of the antebellum South. The Ideology of Slavery includes excerpts by Thomas R. Dew, founder of a new phase of proslavery militancy; William Harper and James Henry Hammond, representatives of the proslavery mainstream; Thornton Stringfellow, the most prominent biblical defender of the peculiar institution; Henry Hughes and Josiah Nott, who brought would-be scientism to the argument; and George Fitzhugh, the most extreme of proslavery writers.The works in this collection portray the development, mature essence, and ultimate fragmentation of the proslavery argument during the era of its greatest importance in the American South. Drew Faust provides a short introduction to each selection, giving information about the author and an account of the origin and publication of the document itself. Faust's introduction to the anthology traces the early historical treatment of proslavery thought and examines the recent resurgence of interest in the ideology of the Old South as a crucial component of powerful relations within that society. She notes the intensification of the proslavery argument between 1830 and 1860, when southern proslavery thought became more systematic and self-conscious, taking on the characteristics of a formal ideology with its resulting social movement. From this intensification came the pragmatic tone and inductive mode that the editor sees as a characteristic of southern proslavery writings from the 1830s onward. The selections, introductory comments, and bibliography of secondary works on the proslavery argument will be of value to readers interested in the history of slavery and of nineteenth-centruy American thought.","author":[{"family":"Faust","given":"Drew Gilpin"}],"citation-key":"faust1981ideology","ISBN":"978-0-8071-5396-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1981",9,1]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"409","publisher":"LSU Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Ideology of Slavery: Proslavery Thought in the Antebellum South, 1830–1860","title-short":"The Ideology of Slavery","type":"book"},{"id":"favilli1996history","abstract":"In The History of Italian Marxism, Paolo Favilli explores how cultures inspired by Marx and 'Marxism' developed in Italy from the time of the First International up till the eve of the First World War.","author":[{"family":"Favilli","given":"Paolo"}],"citation-key":"favilli1996history","ISBN":"978-90-04-32543-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"480","publisher":"BRILL","source":"Google Books","title":"The History of Italian Marxism: From its Origins to the Great War","title-short":"The History of Italian Marxism","type":"book"},{"id":"fay1983influence","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Fay","given":"Margaret"},{"family":"Hengstenberg","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Stuckey","given":"Barbara"}],"citation-key":"fay1983influence","container-title":"Science & Society","ISSN":"0036-8237","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1983"]]},"page":"129-151","publisher":"Guilford Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Influence of Adam Smith on Marx's Theory of Alienation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40402479","volume":"47"},{"id":"federici1975wages","author":[{"family":"Federici","given":"Silvia"}],"citation-key":"federici1975wages","ISBN":"978-0-9502702-9-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1975"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"14","publisher":"Power of Women Collective","source":"Google Books","title":"Wages Against Housework","type":"book"},{"id":"feher1990french","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Fehér","given":"Ferenc"}],"citation-key":"feher1990french","issued":{"date-parts":[["1990"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"University of California Press","source":"www.ucpress.edu","title":"The French Revolution and the Birth of Modernity","type":"book","URL":"https://www.ucpress.edu/op/9780520071209/the-french-revolution-and-the-birth-of-modernity"},{"id":"feller_introduction_1968","author":[{"family":"Feller","given":"W."}],"citation-key":"feller_introduction_1968","edition":"3","event-place":"New York","issued":{"date-parts":[["1968"]]},"language":"en","page":"3","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons","publisher-place":"New York","title":"An introduction to probability theory and its applications","type":"book","volume":"1"},{"id":"feng2022languageagnostic","abstract":"While BERT is an effective method for learning monolingual sentence embeddings for semantic similarity and embedding based transfer learning BERT based cross-lingual sentence embeddings have yet to be explored.

Sociologist Karen E. Fields and historian Barbara J.

So pervasive are the devices of racecraft in American history, economic doctrine, politics, and everyday thinking that the presence of racecraft itself goes unnoticed. That the promised post-racial age has not dawned, the authors argue, reflects the failure of Americans to develop a legitimate language for thinking about and discussing inequality.

A key work in establishing political ideology as a major concern of modern American historians, it remains the only full-scale evaluation of the ideas of the early Republican party. Now with a new introduction, Eric Foner puts his argument into the context of contemporary scholarship, reassessing the concept of free labor in the light of the last twenty-five years of writing on such issues as work, gender, economic change, and political thought.A significant reevaluation of the causes of the Civil War, Foner's study looks beyond the North's opposition to slavery and its emphasis upon preserving the Union to determine the broader grounds of its willingness to undertake a war against the South in 1861. Its search is for those social concepts the North accepted as vital to its way of life, finding these concepts most clearly expressed in the ideology of the growing Republican party in the decade before the war's start. Through a careful analysis of the attitudes of leading factions in the party's formation (northern Whigs, former Democrats, and political abolitionists) Foner is able to show what each contributed to Republican ideology. He also shows how northern ideas of human rights--in particular a man's right to work where and how he wanted, and to accumulate property in his own name--and the goals of American society were implicit in that ideology. This was the ideology that permeated the North in the period directly before the Civil War, led to the election of Abraham Lincoln, and led, almost immediately, to the Civil War itself. At the heart of the controversy over the extension of slavery, he argues, is the issue of whether the northern or southern form of society would take root in the West, whose development would determine the nation's destiny.In his new introductory essay, Foner presents a greatly altered view of the subject. Only entrepreneurs and farmers were actually \"free men\" in the sense used in the ideology of the period. Actually, by the time the Civil War was initiated, half the workers in the North were wage-earners, not independent workers. And this did not account for women and blacks, who had little freedom in choosing what work they did. He goes onto show that even after the Civil War these guarantees for \"free soil, free labor, free men\" did not really apply for most Americans, and especially not for blacks. Demonstrating the profoundly successful fusion of value and interest within Republican ideology prior to the Civil War, Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men remains a classic of modern American historical writing. Eloquent and influential, it shows how this ideology provided the moral consensus which allowed the North, for the first time in history, to mobilize an entire society in modern warfare.","author":[{"family":"Foner","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"foner1995free","edition":"Reprint edition","event-place":"Oxford ; New York","ISBN":"978-0-19-509497-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",4,20]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"400","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford ; New York","source":"Amazon","title":"Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party before the Civil War","title-short":"Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men","type":"book"},{"id":"forbes_further_1857","author":[{"family":"Forbes","given":"J.D."}],"citation-key":"forbes_further_1857","container-title":"Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh","issued":{"date-parts":[["1857"]]},"language":"en","page":"135-143","title":"Further experiments and remarks on the measurement of heights by the boiling point of water","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},{"id":"ford1988republican","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Ford","given":"Lacy K."}],"citation-key":"ford1988republican","container-title":"The Journal of Southern History","DOI":"10.2307/2208996","ISSN":"0022-4642","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988"]]},"page":"405-424","publisher":"Southern Historical Association","source":"JSTOR","title":"Republican Ideology in a Slave Society: The Political Economy of John C.

He analyzed mental institutions in the remarkable Madness and Civilization; hospitals in The Birth of the Clinic; prisons in Discipline and Punish; and schools and families in The History of Sexuality. But the general reader as well as the specialist is apt to miss the consistent purposes that lay behind these difficult individual studies, thus losing sight of the broad social vision and political aims that unified them.Now, in this superb set of essays and interviews, Foucault has provided a much-needed guide to Foucault. These pieces, ranging over the entire spectrum of his concerns, enabled Foucault, in his most intimate and accessible voice, to interpret the conclusions of his research in each area and to demonstrate the contribution of each to the magnificent -- and terrifying -- portrait of society that he was patiently compiling.For, as Foucault shows, what he was always describing was the nature of power in society; not the conventional treatment of power that concentrates on powerful individuals and repressive institutions, but the much more pervasive and insidious mechanisms by which power \"reaches into the very grain of individuals, touches their bodies and inserts itself into their actions and attitudes, their discourses, learning processes and everyday lives\"Foucault's investigations of prisons, schools, barracks, hospitals, factories, cities, lodgings, families, and other organized forms of social life are each a segment of one of the most astonishing intellectual enterprises of all time -- and, as this book proves, one which possesses profound implications for understanding the social control of our bodies and our minds.","author":[{"family":"Foucault","given":"Michel"}],"citation-key":"foucault1980power","ISBN":"978-0-394-73954-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1980",11,12]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"285","publisher":"Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group","source":"Google Books","title":"Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977","title-short":"Power/Knowledge","type":"book"},{"id":"fox1981modernization","author":[{"family":"Fox","given":"Eleanor"}],"citation-key":"fox1981modernization","container-title":"Cornell Law Review","ISSN":"0010-8847","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1981",8,1]]},"page":"1140-1192","title":"Modernization of Antitrust: A New Equilibrium","title-short":"Modernization of Antitrust","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/clr/vol66/iss6/3","volume":"66"},{"id":"france1894lys","author":[{"family":"France","given":"Anatole"}],"citation-key":"france1894lys","issued":{"date-parts":[["1894"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"328","publisher":"G.

It is more than just a topic of intellectual interest: it has become part of a moral and political heritage. But after two centuries, this central event in French history has usually been thought of in much the same terms as it was by its contemporaries. There have been many accounts of the French Revolution, and though their opinions differ, they have often been commemorative or anniversary interpretations of the original event. The dividing line of revolutionary historiography, in intellectual terms, is therefore not between the right and the left, but between commemorative and conceptual history, as exemplified respectively in the works of Michelet and Tocquevifle. In this book, François Furet analyses how an event like the French Revolution can be conceptualised, and identifies the radically new changes the Revolution produced as well as the continuity it provided, albeit under the appearance of change. This question has become a riddle for the European left, answered neither by Marx nor by the theorists of our own century. In his analysis of the tragic relevance of the Revolution, Furet both refers to contemporary experience and discusses various elements in the work of Alexis de Tocclueville and that of Augustin Cochin, which has never been systematically applied by historians of the Revolution. Furet's book is based on the complementary ideas of these two writers in an attempt to cut through the apparent and misleading clarity of various contradictory views of the Revolution, and to help decipher some of the enigmatic problems of revolutionary ideology. It will be of value to historians of modern Europe and their students; to political, social and economic historians; to sociologists; and to students of political thought.","author":[{"family":"Furet","given":"François"}],"citation-key":"furet1978interpreting","ISBN":"978-0-521-28049-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1978"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"220","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Interpreting the French Revolution","type":"book"},{"id":"gabriel2011love","abstract":"Brilliantly researched and wonderfully written, Love and Capital reveals the rarely glimpsed and heartbreakingly human side of the man whose works would redefine the world after his death.Drawing upon previously unpublished material, acclaimed biographer Mary Gabriel tells the story of Karl and Jenny Marx's marriage.

This review argues that the term points to a whole family of semiotic processes.

This generative process mediates among the domains of knowledge and action that the communications themselves play a role in separating. The connections and differentiations, as framed by metadiscourses, construct relations of power and politics. I seek to highlight a widening, productive conversation about translational practices among studies of science, in medical, legal, and linguistic anthropology, in research on Christianities, and in advocacy. The translation rubric gathers together practices of transduction, (in)commensuration, circulation, enactment of reference, standardizations, and various forms of boundary making.

We introduce Correlation Explanation (CorEx), an alternative approach to topic modeling that does not assume an underlying generative model, and instead learns maximally informative topics through an information-theoretic framework. This framework naturally generalizes to hierarchical and semi-supervised extensions with no additional modeling assumptions. In particular, word-level domain knowledge can be flexibly incorporated within CorEx through anchor words, allowing topic separability and representation to be promoted with minimal human intervention. Across a variety of datasets, metrics, and experiments, we demonstrate that CorEx produces topics that are comparable in quality to those produced by unsupervised and semi-supervised variants of LDA.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Gallagher","given":"Ryan J."},{"family":"Reing","given":"Kyle"},{"family":"Kale","given":"David"},{"family":"Steeg","given":"Greg Ver"}],"citation-key":"gallagher2017anchored","container-title":"Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics","ISSN":"2307-387X","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,2]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics","number":"0","page":"529-542","source":"transacl.org","title":"Anchored Correlation Explanation: Topic Modeling with Minimal Domain Knowledge","title-short":"Anchored Correlation Explanation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://transacl.org/ojs/index.php/tacl/article/view/1244","volume":"5"},{"id":"galton1919inquiries","abstract":"\"Since the publication of my work on Hereditary Genius in 1869, I have written numerous memoirs, which are scattered in various publications.

Gardner's array of absorbing puzzles and mind-twisting paradoxes opens mathematics up to the world at large, inspiring people to see past numbers and formulas and experience the application of mathematical principles to the mysterious world around them. With articles on topics ranging from simple algebra to the twisting surfaces of Mobius strips, from an endless game of Bulgarian solitaire to the unreachable dream of time travel, this volume comprises a substantial and definitive monument to Gardner's influence on mathematics, science, and culture.  In its twelve sections, The Colossal Book of Math explores a wide range of areas, each startlingly illuminated by Gardner's incisive expertise. Beginning with seemingly simple topics, Gardner expertly guides us through complicated and wondrous worlds: by way of basic algebra we contemplate the mesmerizing, often hilarious, linguistic and numerical possibilities of palindromes; using simple geometry, he dissects the principles of symmetry upon which the renowned mathematical artist M. C. Escher constructs his unique, dizzying universe. Gardner, like few thinkers today, melds a rigorous scientific skepticism with a profound artistic and imaginative impulse. His stunning exploration of \"The Church of the Fourth Dimension,\" for example, bridges the disparate worlds of religion and science by brilliantly imagining the spatial possibility of God's presence in the world as a fourth dimension, at once \"everywhere and nowhere.\"  With boundless wisdom and his trademark wit, Gardner allows the reader to further engage challenging topics like probability and game theory which have plagued clever gamblers, and famous mathematicians, for centuries. Whether debunking Pascal's wager with basic probability, making visual music with fractals, or uncoiling a \"knotted doughnut\" with introductory topology, Gardner continuously displays his fierce intelligence and gentle humor. His articles confront both the comfortingly mundane—\"Generalized Ticktacktoe\" and \"Sprouts and Brussel Sprouts\"—and the quakingly abstract—\"Hexaflexagons,\" \"Nothing,\" and \"Everything.\" He navigates these staggeringly obscure topics with a deft intelligence and, with addendums and suggested reading lists, he informs these classic articles with new insight.  Admired by scientists and mathematicians, writers and readers alike, Gardner's vast knowledge and burning curiosity reveal themselves on every page. The culmination of a lifelong devotion to the wonders of mathematics, The Colossal Book of Mathematics is the largest and most comprehensive math book ever assembled by Gardner and remains an indispensable volume for the amateur and expert alike.","author":[{"family":"Gardner","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"gardner2001colossal","ISBN":"978-0-393-02023-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"748","publisher":"W.

The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images.

Culture, Geertz argues, does not drive human behavior. Rather, it is a web of symbols that can help us better understand what that behavior means. A thick description explains not only the behavior, but the context in which it occurs, and to describe something thickly, Geertz argues, is the fundamental role of the anthropologist.Named one of the 100 most important books published since World War II by the Times Literary Supplement, The Interpretation of Cultures transformed how we think about others' cultures and our own. This definitive edition, with a foreword by Robert Darnton, remains an essential book for anthropologists, historians, and anyone else seeking to better understand human cultures.","author":[{"family":"Geertz","given":"Clifford"}],"citation-key":"geertz1973interpretation","ISBN":"978-0-465-09719-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1973"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"484","publisher":"Basic Books","source":"Google Books","title":"The Interpretation Of Cultures","type":"book"},{"id":"gelfand_samplingbased_1990","author":[{"family":"Gelfand","given":"A.E."},{"family":"Smith","given":"A.F.M."}],"citation-key":"gelfand_samplingbased_1990","container-title":"Journal of the American Statistical Association","issued":{"date-parts":[["1990"]]},"language":"en","page":"398-409","title":"Sampling-based approaches to calculating marginal densities","type":"article-journal","volume":"85"},{"id":"gelman_bayesian_1995","author":[{"family":"Gelman","given":"A."},{"family":"Carlin","given":"J.B."},{"family":"Stern","given":"H.S."},{"family":"Rubin","given":"D.B."}],"citation-key":"gelman_bayesian_1995","event-place":"London","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995"]]},"publisher":"Chapman and Hall","publisher-place":"London","title":"Bayesian Data Analysis","type":"book"},{"id":"gelman2007data","abstract":"Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models is a comprehensive manual for the applied researcher who wants to perform data analysis using linear and nonlinear regression and multilevel models.

His later writings are informed by an idea of a specifically human nature that fulfills both explanatory and normative functions.The belief that Marx’s historical materialism entailed a denial of the conception of human nature is, Geras writes, “an old fixation, which the Althusserian influence in this matter has fed upon … Because this fixation still exists and is misguided, it is still necessary to challenge it.” One hundred years after Marx’s death, this timely essay—combining the strengths of analytical philosophy and classical Marxism—rediscovers a central part of his heritage.","author":[{"family":"Geras","given":"Norman"}],"citation-key":"geras1983marx","ISBN":"978-1-78478-237-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1983"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"82","publisher":"Verso Books","source":"Google Books","title":"Marx and Human Nature: Refutation of a Legend","title-short":"Marx and Human Nature","type":"book"},{"id":"gerow2018measuring","abstract":"Assessing scholarly influence is critical for understanding the collective system of scholarship and the history of academic inquiry.

We perform in-depth analyses on collections of physics research (500,000 abstracts; 102 years) and scholarship generally (JSTOR repository: 2 million full-text articles; 130 years). Our measure of document influence helps predict citations and shows how outcomes, such as winning a Nobel Prize or affiliation with a highly ranked institution, boost influence. Analysis of citations alongside discursive influence reveals that citations tend to credit authors who persist in their fields over time and discount credit for works that are influential over many topics or are “ahead of their time.” In this way, our measures provide a way to acknowledge diverse contributions that take longer and travel farther to achieve scholarly appreciation, enabling us to correct citation biases and enhance sensitivity to the full spectrum of scholarly impact.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Gerow","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Yuening"},{"family":"Boyd-Graber","given":"Jordan"},{"family":"Blei","given":"David M."},{"family":"Evans","given":"James A."}],"citation-key":"gerow2018measuring","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1719792115","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,27]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

Inspired perhaps by the globalised world in which they write, scholars have emphasised how the circulation of people, objects, and ideas linked the distant reaches of the early modern world. Yet for all the advocates of such a 'connected history', we are only beginning to make sense of what global connectedness meant in practice in the lives of ordinary people. To this end, The Whispers of Cities explores interactions between early modern Europe and the Ottoman Empire through the kaleidoscope of communication. It does so by focusing on how information flows linked Istanbul, London, and Paris in the late seventeenth century. Because individuals were at the heart of communication, the book offers a micro-historical reading of the experiences of Sir William Trumbull, English ambassador to Istanbul from 1687 to 1692. It follows Trumbull as he was transformed from a civil lawyer and state official in London to a European notable at the heart of Ottoman social networks in Istanbul. In this way, The Whispers of Cities reveals how information flows between Istanbul, London, and Paris were rooted in the personal encounters that took place between Ottomans and Europeans in everyday communication. At the intersection of global history and the history of communication, therefore, the author argues that worlds of information tied Europeans to their Ottoman counterparts long before the age of modernisation, as news, stories, and even fictions transcended linguistic and confessional boundaries and connected people across Europe and the Mediterranean world. What emerges here is a picture of globalization that is as much about networks, flows, and circulation as it is about the imperfections, asymmetries, and unevenness of connectedness in the early modern world.","author":[{"family":"Ghobrial","given":"John-Paul A."}],"citation-key":"ghobrial2013whispers","ISBN":"978-0-19-967241-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"209","publisher":"OUP Oxford","source":"Google Books","title":"The Whispers of Cities: Information Flows in Istanbul, London, and Paris in the Age of William Trumbull","title-short":"The Whispers of Cities","type":"book"},{"id":"giddens1979central","abstract":"In this new and brilliantly organized book of essays, Anthony Giddens discusses three main theoretical traditions in social science that cut across the division between Marxist and non-Marxist sociology: interpretive sociology, functionalism, and structuralism.Beginning with a critical examination of the importance of structuralism for contemporary sociology, the author develops a comprehensive account of what he calls \"the theory of structuration.\" One of the main themes is that social theory must recognize, as it has not done hitherto, that all social actors are knowledgeable about the social systems they produce and reproduce in their conduct. In order to grasp the significance of this, he argues, we have to reconsider some of the most basic concepts in sociology.In particular, Giddens argues, it is essential to recognize the significance of time-space relations in social theory. He rejects the distinction between synchrony and diachrony, or statics and dynamics, involved in both structuralism and functionalism, and offers extensive critical commentary on the latter as an approach to sociology.The book, which can be described as a \"non-functionalist manifesto,\" breaks with the three main theoretical traditions in the social sciences today while retaining the significant contributions each contains. In so doing Giddens discusses a range of fundamental problem areas in the social sciences: power and domination, conflict and contradiction, and social transformation.

In this problem-oriented introduction to the field, Herbert Gintis exposes students to the techniques and applications of game theory through a wealth of sophisticated and surprisingly fun-to-solve problems involving human (and even animal) behavior.  Game Theory Evolving is innovative in several ways. First, it reflects game theory's expansion into such areas as cooperation in teams, networks, the evolution and diffusion of preferences, the connection between biology and economics, artificial life simulations, and experimental economics. Second, the book--recognizing that students learn by doing and that most game theory texts are weak on problems--is organized around problems, and introduces principles through practice. Finally, the quality of the problems is simply unsurpassed, and each chapter provides a study plan for instructors interested in teaching evolutionary game theory.  Reflecting the growing consensus that in many important contexts outside of anonymous markets, human behavior is not well described by classical \"rationality,\" Gintis shows students how to apply game theory to model how people behave in ways that reflect the special nature of human sociality and individuality.

Because such behavior can be understood only through transdisciplinary research, Gintis argues, Individuality and Entanglement advances the effort to unify the behavioral sciences by developing a shared analytical framework—one that bridges research on gene-culture coevolution, the rational-actor model, game theory, and complexity theory. At the same time, the book persuasively demonstrates the rich possibilities of such transdisciplinary work.Everything distinctive about human social life, Gintis argues, flows from the fact that we construct and then play social games. Indeed, society itself is a game with rules, and politics is the arena in which we affirm and change these rules. Individuality is central to our species because the rules do not change through inexorable macrosocial forces. Rather, individuals band together to change the rules. Our minds are also socially entangled, producing behavior that is socially rational, although it violates the standard rules of individually rational choice. Finally, a moral sense is essential for playing games with socially constructed rules. People generally play by the rules, are ashamed when they break the rules, and are offended when others break the rules, even in societies that lack laws, government, and jails.Throughout the book, Gintis shows that it is only by bringing together the behavioral sciences that such basic aspects of human behavior can be understood.","author":[{"family":"Gintis","given":"Herbert"}],"citation-key":"gintis2016individuality","ISBN":"978-1-4008-8316-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,18]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"380","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Individuality and Entanglement: The Moral and Material Bases of Social Life","title-short":"Individuality and Entanglement","type":"book"},{"id":"gleijeses2002conflicting","abstract":"This is a compelling and dramatic account of Cuban policy in Africa from 1959 to 1976 and of its escalating clash with U.S. policy toward the continent.

First, we examine how behavior changes as individuals spend more time online, showing that the heaviest users devote nearly twice as much of their time to social media relative to typical individuals. Second, we revisit the digital divide, finding that the frequency with which individuals turn to the Web for research, news, and healthcare is strongly related to educational background, but not as closely tied to gender and ethnicity.

She finds the very epicenter of the Enlightenment in a community of discourse known as the Republic of Letters, where salons governed by women advanced the Enlightenment project \"to change the common way of thinking.\" Goodman details the history of the Republic of Letters in the Parisian salons, where men and women, philosophes and salonnieres, together not only introduced reciprocity into intellectual life through the practices of letter writing and polite conversation but also developed a republican model of government that was to challenge the monarchy. Providing a new understanding of women's importance in the Enlightenment, Goodman demonstrates that in the Republic of Letters men and women played complementary - and unequal - roles. Salonnieres governed the Republic of Letters by enforcing rules of polite conversation that made possible a discourse characterized by liberty and civility. Goodman chronicles the story of the Republic of Letters from its earliest formation through major periods of change: the production of the Encyclopedia, the proliferation of a print culture that widened circles of readership beyond the control of salon governance, and the early years of the French Revolution. Although the legacy of the Republic of Letters remained a force in French cultural and political life, in the 1780s men formed new intellectual institutions that asserted their ability to govern themselves and that marginalized women. TheRepublic of Letters introduces provocative explanations both for the failure of the Enlightenment and for the role of the Enlightenment in the French Revolution.","author":[{"family":"Goodman","given":"Dena"}],"citation-key":"goodman1996republic","ISBN":"978-0-8014-8174-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"356","publisher":"Cornell University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Republic of Letters: A Cultural History of the French Enlightenment","title-short":"The Republic of Letters","type":"book"},{"id":"goodrich2013data","abstract":"Based on the authors’ market leading data structures books in Java and C++, this textbook offers a comprehensive, definitive introduction to data structures in Python by authoritative authors.

The conservative movement that reached out to Strauss and his legacy was extremely fluid and lacked a self-confident leadership. Conservative activists and journalists felt a desperate need for academic acceptability, which they thought Strauss and his disciples would furnish. They also became deeply concerned with the problem of 'value relativism', which self-described conservatives thought Strauss had effectively addressed.

Contrary to another misconception, Straussians have never wished to convert Americans to ancient political ideals and practices, except in a very selective rhetorical fashion.

Further, he has added five essays on questions of The Bell Curve in particular and on race, racism, and biological determinism in general. These additions strengthen the book's claim to be, as Leo J.

This system of cooperative production would realize republican liberty in economic, not just political, life. Today, neo-republicans argue that the republican theory of liberty only requires a universal basic income. A non-dominated ability to exit is sufficient to guarantee free labor. This essay reconstructs the more radical, labor republican view and defends it against the prevailing the neo-republican one. It argues that neorepublicanism lacks an adequate conception of structural domination, which leaves it without theoretical resources to address certain forms of economic domination. The concept of structural domination allows us to comprehend the coherence of the nineteenth century, labor republican view and identify its relevance to modern labor markets. Labor republicanism takes us beyond a universal basic income to a concern with control over productive assets and workplace organization. As such, it shows us how the republican theory of liberty can support an argument for the transformation of work, not just the escape from it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Gourevitch","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"gourevitch2013labor","container-title":"Political Theory","DOI":"10.1177/0090591713485370","ISSN":"0090-5917","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"591-617","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Labor Republicanism and the Transformation of Work","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0090591713485370","volume":"41"},{"id":"gourevitch2015liberty","abstract":"The revival of classical liberal thought has reignited a debate about economic freedom and social justice. Classical liberals claim to defend expansive economic freedom, while their critics wish to restrict this freedom for other values. However, there are two problems with the role ?economic freedom? plays in this debate: inconsistency in the use of the concept and indeterminacy with respect to its definition. Inconsistency in the use of the concept ?freedom? has mistakenly made a certain kind of ?left-wing? critique of poverty, and of markets generally, appear to be a concern with inequality in means to enjoy freedom, not with freedom itself. Indeterminacy about which beings and doings the basic liberties protect misrepresents the left-wing position as about something other than economic freedom. Inconsistency and indeterminacy lead to artificial narrowness in current debates and to a failure to see that disagreement is based not just on moral differences but also on conceptual confusion. This confusion leads both classical liberals and their critics to claim more than they may legitimately do, and to ignore a position that accepts the standard of definition of freedom but arrives at different institutional conclusions about what secures that freedom.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Gourevitch","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"gourevitch2015liberty","container-title":"Politics, Philosophy & Economics","DOI":"10.1177/1470594X14564507","ISSN":"1470-594X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"365-390","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Liberty and its economies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1470594X14564507","volume":"14"},{"id":"gourevitch2015slavery","abstract":"This book reconstructs how a group of nineteenth-century labor reformers appropriated and radicalized the republican tradition.

Standard economic theory did not give much credit to the role of networks until the early 1990s, but since then the study of the theory of networks has blossomed. At the heart of this research is the idea that the pattern of connections between individual rational agents shapes their actions and determines their rewards. The importance of connections has in turn motivated the study of the very processes by which networks are formed. In Connections, Sanjeev Goyal puts contemporary thinking about networks and economic activity into context. He develops a general framework within which this body of research can be located. In the first part of the book he demonstrates that location in a network has significant effects on individual rewards and that, given this, it is natural that individuals will seek to form connections to move the network in their favor. This idea motivates the second part of the book, which develops a general theory of network formation founded on individual incentives. Goyal assesses the robustness of current research findings and identifies the substantive open questions. Written in a style that combines simple examples with formal models and complete mathematical proofs, Connections is a concise and self-contained treatment of the economic theory of networks, one that should become the natural source of reference for graduate students in economics and related disciplines.","author":[{"family":"Goyal","given":"Sanjeev"}],"citation-key":"goyal2012connections","ISBN":"978-1-4008-2916-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",1,12]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"303","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Connections: An Introduction to the Economics of Networks","title-short":"Connections","type":"book"},{"id":"graham1981illocution","author":[{"family":"Graham","given":"Keith"}],"citation-key":"graham1981illocution","container-title":"Issues in Marxist Philosophy","editor":[{"family":"Mepham","given":"John"},{"family":"Ruben","given":"DH"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1981"]]},"page":"153–194","title":"Illocution and ideology","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},{"id":"graham1992karl","abstract":"The work of Karl Marx is often misunderstood through misleading association with figures such as Lenin.

Reconstructing Marx's philosophical assumptions more explicitly than he did himself, the author then evaluates Marx's general view of human life and society, his specific theory of capitalism and his philosophy of change. The importance of class, Marx's materialism and his problematic relationship with morality are described and critically assessed. Arriving at a view quite different from received interpretations, Graham argues that Marx's philosophy has contemporary relevance and survives the collapse of Leninism. It is a philosophy at once more extreme and more moderate than usually thought: more extreme in rejecting all forms of commodity or market society, but more moderate in its choice of the political methods employed for the transcending of capitalism.

These people doing \"ghost work\" make the internet seem smart. They perform high-tech piecework: flagging X-rated content, proofreading, designing engine parts, and much more. An estimated 8 percent of Americans have worked at least once in this “ghost economy,” and that number is growing. They usually earn less than legal minimums for traditional work, they have no health benefits, and they can be fired at any time for any reason, or none. There are no labor laws to govern this kind of work, and these latter-day assembly lines draw in—and all too often overwork and underpay—a surprisingly diverse range of workers: harried young mothers, professionals forced into early retirement, recent grads who can’t get a toehold on the traditional employment ladder, and minorities shut out of the jobs they want.

Using this framework, he demonstrates how our standards of social coordination both gain in value the more they are used and undermine the viability of alternative forms of cooperation. A wide range of examples are discussed, from the spread of English and the gold standard to the success of Microsoft and the operation of the World Trade Organization, to illustrate how global standards arise and falter. The idea of network power supplies a coherent set of terms and concepts—applicable to individuals, businesses, and countries alike—through which we can describe the processes of globalization as both free and forced.  The result is a sophisticated and novel account of how globalization, and politics, work.","author":[{"family":"Grewal","given":"David Singh"}],"citation-key":"grewal2008network","ISBN":"978-0-300-14512-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",10,1]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"416","publisher":"Yale University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Network Power: The Social Dynamics of Globalization","title-short":"Network Power","type":"book"},{"id":"grice1969utterer","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Grice","given":"H.

However, ℓ1 minimization does not always yield sufficiently sparse solution in many practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel SRC method, namely the ℓp (0<p<1) sparse representation based classification (ℓp-SRC), to seek for the optimal sparse representation of a testing image. In ℓp-SRC, the ℓp (0<p<1) minimization is adopted as an alternative to ℓ0 minimization, the solution of which is sparser than that of ℓ1 minimization used in traditional SRC. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm is introduced to efficiently solve the ℓp minimization problem in this paper. The extensive experimental results on publicly available face databases demonstrate the effectiveness of ℓp-SRC for robust face recognition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Guo","given":"Song"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhan"},{"family":"Ruan","given":"Qiuqi"}],"citation-key":"guo2013enhancing","container-title":"Neurocomputing","container-title-short":"Neurocomputing","DOI":"10.1016/j.neucom.2012.05.028","ISSN":"0925-2312","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1,1]]},"page":"592-602","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Enhancing sparsity via ℓp (0","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231212006017","volume":"99"},{"id":"gupta2019karl","abstract":"Since the latest crisis of capitalism broke out in 2008, Marx has been back in fashion, and sometimes it seems that his ideas have never been as topical, or as commanding of respect and interest, as they are today.

These contributions, from multiple academic disciplines, offer diverse perspectives on why Marx is still so relevant for our times and make this book a source of great appeal for both expert scholars of Marx as well as students and general readers who are approaching his theories for the first time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,27]]},"citation-key":"gupta2019karl","collection-title":"Marx, Engels, and Marxisms","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-24815-4","editor":[{"family":"Gupta","given":"Shaibal"},{"family":"Musto","given":"Marcello"},{"family":"Amini","given":"Babak"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-3-030-24814-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan","publisher-place":"London","source":"www.palgrave.com","title":"Karl Marx’s Life, Ideas, and Influences: A Critical Examination on the Bicentenary","title-short":"Karl Marx’s Life, Ideas, and Influences","type":"book","URL":"https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783030248147"},{"id":"gurr1970why","abstract":"Why Men Rebel was first published in 1970 after a decade of political violence across the world.

The introductory chapter provides a comparatively informed framework for analyzing the interplay of markets and politics in the United States, focusing on three key factors: uniquely fragmented and decentralized political institutions; an interest group landscape characterized by weak labor organizations and powerful, parochial business groups; and an entrenched legacy of ethno-racial divisions embedded in both government and markets. Subsequent chapters look at the fundamental dynamics that result, including the place of the courts in multi-venue politics, the political economy of labor, sectional conflict within and across cities and regions, the consolidation of financial markets and corporate monopoly and monopsony power, and the ongoing rise of the knowledge economy. Together, the chapters provide a revealing new map of the politics of democratic capitalism in the United States.","author":[{"family":"Hacker","given":"Jacob S."},{"family":"Hertel-Fernandez","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Pierson","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Thelen","given":"Kathleen"}],"citation-key":"hacker2021american","ISBN":"978-1-316-51636-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,11]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"487","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The American Political Economy: Politics, Markets, and Power","title-short":"The American Political Economy","type":"book"},{"id":"hacking1975emergence","abstract":"Historical records show that there was no real concept of probability in Europe before the mid-seventeenth century, although the use of dice and other randomizing objects was commonplace. Ian Hacking presents a philosophical critique of early ideas about probability, induction, and statistical inference and the growth of this new family of ideas in the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries. Hacking invokes a wide intellectual framework involving the growth of science, economics, and the theology of the period. He argues that the transformations that made it possible for probability concepts to emerge have constrained all subsequent development of probability theory and determine the space within which philosophical debate on the subject is still conducted. First published in 1975, this edition includes an introduction that contextualizes his book in light of developing philosophical trends.

Concerning the epistemic dimension, Marx's views are often misunderstood due to neglect of the differentiation between the categories appearance and manifestation, as can be seen in the works of C. J. Arthur and P. Murray. Ben Fowkes' English translation of Capital is, in this respect, not precise enough and, at times, even highly misleading, as can be seen by comparing it to the second MEGA (MEGA²) edition. Removing these confusions reveals Marx's value theory to be profoundly scientific and of great current importance, especially when it is seen that Marx advances beyond the category structure in Hegel in crucial ways, and that his theory requires clear distinction and re-integration of both quantitative and qualitative aspects, and of both sociological and political—economic dimensions of labor, at each stage — appearance, essence, manifestation — in the development of the value dialectic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Hanzel","given":"Igor"}],"citation-key":"hanzel2010mistranslations","container-title":"Science & Society","ISSN":"0036-8237","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"509-537","publisher":"[Guilford Press, S&S Quarterly, Inc.]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Mistranslations of `Schein' and `Erscheinung': The Structure of Chapter 1 of \"Capital\", Volume I","title-short":"Mistranslations of \"Schein\" and \"Erscheinung\"","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/25769063","volume":"74"},{"id":"hargreaves-heap2002game","abstract":"First published in 1995.

I interpret the volatility of international capitalism during these years, however, as a series of temporary spatio-temporal fixes that failed even in the medium run to deal with problems of overaccumulation. It was, as Peter Gowan argues, through the orchestration of such volatility that the United States sought to preserve its hegemonic position within global capitalism. The recent apparent shift towards an open imperialism backed by military force on the part of the US may then be seen as a sign of the weakening of that hegemony before the serious threat of recession and widespread devaluation at home, as opposed to the various bouts of devaluation formerly inflicted elsewhere (Latin America in the 1980s and early 1990s, and, even more seriously, the crisis that consumed East and South-East Asia in 1997 and then engulfed Russia and much of Latin America). But I also want to argue that the inability to accumulate through expanded reproduction on a sustained basis has been paralleled by a rise in attempts to accumulate by dispossession.

With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression & path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap.

I argue that there is an important and easily defensible principle underlying the system—it is designed to channel labour to its best employment, the way that it does any other resource. But many consider this defence too minimal, and so strive to find a thicker, more robust moral principle that can be used to defend the market, using concepts like ‘contribution’, ‘effort’, ‘laziness’, ‘skill’ or ‘talent’—all of which combine to provide a concept of ‘desert’, or ‘fairness’ in compensation. The objective of this paper is to caution against such overreach. I begin by articulating what I take to be the central principle underlying the determination of wages. I go on to discuss three different ways that both critics and defenders of the market have sought to go further than this, by introducing thicker moral concepts to the discussion, and why each of these initiatives fails. My central contention will be that markets are structurally unable to deliver ‘just’ wages, according to any everyday-moral understanding of what justice requires in cooperative interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Heath","given":"Joseph"}],"citation-key":"heath2018very","container-title":"Erasmus Journal for Philosophy and Economics","DOI":"10.23941/ejpe.v11i2.326","ISSN":"1876-9098","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,10]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2018 Joseph Heath","number":"2","page":"1-33","source":"ejpe.org","title":"On the Very Idea of a Just Wage","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ejpe.org/journal/article/view/326","volume":"11"},{"id":"heavenrich_light_1999","author":[{"family":"Heavenrich","given":"R.M."},{"family":"Hellman","given":"K.H."}],"citation-key":"heavenrich_light_1999","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"en","number":"EPA420-R-99-018","publisher":"US Environmental Protection Agency","title":"Light duty automotive technology and fuel economy trends through 1999","type":"report"},{"id":"hecker2003entstehungs","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Hecker","given":"Rolf"}],"citation-key":"hecker2003entstehungs","container-title":"Trend","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"title":"Die Entstehungs-, Überlieferungs- und Editionsgeschichte der ökonomischen Manuskripte und des \"Kapital\"","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mxks.de/files/mew/Hecker.EntstehungsgeschDKapitals.t281203.html"},{"id":"heffernan2022bitext","abstract":"Scaling multilingual representation learning beyond the hundred most frequent languages is challenging, in particular to cover the long tail of low-resource languages. A promising approach has been to train one-for-all multilingual models capable of cross-lingual transfer, but these models often suffer from insufficient capacity and interference between unrelated languages. Instead, we move away from this approach and focus on training multiple language (family) specific representations, but most prominently enable all languages to still be encoded in the same representational space. To achieve this, we focus on teacher-student training, allowing all encoders to be mutually compatible for bitext mining, and enabling fast learning of new languages. We introduce a new teacher-student training scheme which combines supervised and self-supervised training, allowing encoders to take advantage of monolingual training data, which is valuable in the low-resource setting. Our approach significantly outperforms the original LASER encoder. We study very low-resource languages and handle 50 African languages, many of which are not covered by any other model. For these languages, we train sentence encoders, mine bitexts, and validate the bitexts by training NMT systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Heffernan","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Çelebi","given":"Onur"},{"family":"Schwenk","given":"Holger"}],"citation-key":"heffernan2022bitext","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2205.12654","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,25]]},"number":"arXiv:2205.12654","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Bitext Mining Using Distilled Sentence Representations for Low-Resource Languages","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12654"},{"id":"hegel_werke7_1820","author":[{"family":"Hegel","given":"Georg Wilhelm Friedrich"}],"citation-key":"hegel_werke7_1820","edition":"8.

Although mainstream economists and commentators once dismissed Marx's work as outmoded and flawed, some are begrudgingly acknowledging an analysis that sees capitalism as inherently unstable. And of course, there are those, like Michael Heinrich, who have seen the value of Marx all along, and are in a unique position to explain the intricacies of Marx's thought.Heinrich's modern interpretation of Capital is now available to English-speaking readers for the first time. It has gone through nine editions in Germany, is the standard work for Marxist study groups, and is used widely in German universities. The author systematically covers all three volumes of Capital and explains all the basic aspects of Marx's critique of capitalism in a way that is clear and concise. He provides background information on the intellectual and political milieu in which Marx worked, and looks at crucial issues beyond the scope of Capital, such as class struggle, the relationship between capital and the state, accusations of historical determinism, and Marx's understanding of communism. Uniquely, Heinrich emphasizes the monetary character of Marx's work, in addition to the traditional emphasis on the labor theory of value, this highlighting the relevance of Capital to the age of financial explosions and implosions.","author":[{"family":"Heinrich","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"heinrich2012introduction","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-58367-291-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6,1]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"240","publisher":"NYU Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Google Books","title":"An Introduction to the Three Volumes of Karl Marx's Capital","type":"book"},{"id":"heinrich2016capital","author":[{"family":"Heinrich","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"heinrich2016capital","container-title":"Crisis and critique","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"92–138","source":"Google Scholar","title":"'Capital' after MEGA: Discontinuities, Interruptions, and New Beginnings","title-short":"'Capital'after MEGA","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},{"id":"heinrich2018karl","author":[{"family":"Heinrich","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"heinrich2018karl","ISBN":"978-3-89657-085-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"de","number-of-pages":"book","publisher":"Schmetterling Verlag","source":"Google Books","title":"Karl Marx und die Geburt der modernen Gesellschaft: 1818-1841","title-short":"Karl Marx und die Geburt der modernen Gesellschaft","type":"book"},{"id":"heinrich2019karl","abstract":"For over a century, Karl Marx’s critique of capitalism has been a crucial resource for social movements. Now, recent economic crises have made it imperative for us to comprehend and actualize Marx’s ideas. But without a knowledge of Karl Marx’s life as he lived it, neither Marx nor his works can be fully understood. There are more than twenty-five comprehensive biographies of Marx, but none of them consider his life and work in equal, corresponding measure. This biography, planned for three volumes, aims to include what most biographies have reduced to mere background: the contemporary conflicts, struggles, and disputes that engaged Marx at the time of his writings, alongside his complex relationships with a varied assortment of friends and opponents. This first volume will deal extensively with Marx’s youth in Trier and his studies in Bonn and Berlin. It will also examine the function of poetry in his intellectual development and his first occupation with Hegelian philosophy and with the so-called “young Hegelians” in his 1841 Dissertation. Already during this period, there were crises as well as breaks in Marx’s intellectual development that prompted Marx to give up projects and re-conceptualize his critical enterprise. This volume is the beginning of an astoundingly dimensional look at Karl Marx – a study of a complex life and body of work through the neglected issues, events, and people that helped comprise both. It is destined to become a classic.","author":[{"family":"Heinrich","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"heinrich2019karl","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-58367-736-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"392","publisher":"NYU Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Google Books","title":"Karl Marx and the Birth of Modern Society: The Life of Marx and the Development of His Work","title-short":"Karl Marx and the Birth of Modern Society","type":"book"},{"id":"heisenberg1932development","author":[{"family":"Heisenberg","given":"Werner"}],"citation-key":"heisenberg1932development","container-title":"Nobel Lecture","issued":{"date-parts":[["1932"]]},"language":"en","page":"12","source":"Zotero","title":"The Development of Quantum Mechanics","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"heller1976theory","abstract":"The first full presentation of a fundamental aspect of Marx, the concept of needWhat are needs?

Albert O. Hirschman makes a basic distinction between alternative ways of reacting to deterioration in business firms and, in general, to dissatisfaction with organizations: one, “exit,” is for the member to quit the organization or for the customer to switch to the competing product, and the other, “voice,” is for members or customers to agitate and exert influence for change “from within.” The efficiency of the competitive mechanism, with its total reliance on exit, is questioned for certain important situations. As exit often undercuts voice while being unable to counteract decline, loyalty is seen in the function of retarding exit and of permitting voice to play its proper role.The interplay of the three concepts turns out to illuminate a wide range of economic, social, and political phenomena. As the author states in the preface, “having found my own unifying way of looking at issues as diverse as competition and the two-party system, divorce and the American character, black power and the failure of ‘unhappy’ top officials to resign over Vietnam, I decided to let myself go a little.”","author":[{"family":"Hirschman","given":"Albert O."}],"citation-key":"hirschman1970exit","ISBN":"978-0-674-27660-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1970"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"180","publisher":"Harvard University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Exit, Voice, and Loyalty: Responses to Decline in Firms, Organizations, and States","title-short":"Exit, Voice, and Loyalty","type":"book"},{"id":"hlavackova-schindler2012assumption","abstract":"Open access peer-reviewed chapter","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Hlaváčková-Schindler","given":"Kateřina"}],"citation-key":"hlavackova-schindler2012assumption","DOI":"10.5772/38542","ISBN":"978-953-51-0687-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",8,16]]},"language":"en","publisher":"IntechOpen","source":"www.intechopen.com","title":"The Assumption of Non-Gaussianity in Natural and Social Sciences and Its Influence on Detection of Causal Relationships","type":"book","URL":"https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/undefined/state.item.id"},{"id":"hobbes1651leviathan","abstract":"This Norton Critical Edition includes:  The complete text of Leviathan, one of the most important works of political philosophy ever written, carefully--and faithfully--edited for 21st-century readers.

Although individuals can gain critical benefits from their position in a hierarchy, we do not understand how real-world hierarchies form. Nor do we understand what signals and decision-rules individuals use to construct and maintain hierarchies in the absence of simple cues such as size or spatial location. A study of conflict in two groups of captive monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) found that a transition to large-scale order in aggression occurred in newly-formed groups after one week, with individuals thereafter preferring to direct aggression more frequently against those nearby in rank. We consider two cognitive mechanisms underlying the emergence of this order: inference based on overall levels of aggression, or on subsets of the aggression network. Both mechanisms were predictive of individual decisions to aggress, but observed patterns were better explained by rank inference through subsets of the aggression network. Based on these results, we present a new theory, of a feedback loop between knowledge of rank and consequent behavior. This loop explains the transition to strategic aggression and the formation and persistence of dominance hierarchies in groups capable of both social memory and inference.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Hobson","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"DeDeo","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"hobson2015social","container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004411","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,10]]},"language":"en","page":"e1004411","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Social Feedback and the Emergence of Rank in Animal Society","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004411","volume":"11"},{"id":"hodgkinson1955doubletalk","author":[{"family":"Hodgkinson","given":"Harry"}],"citation-key":"hodgkinson1955doubletalk","issued":{"date-parts":[["1955"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"180","publisher":"G.

Howard argues that this shift can be understood only in terms of an analysis of the theoretical development of the Marxian dialectic. In explicating the systematic aspects of Marx’s theory, Howard has gone anew to the primary sources, the writings of Marx himself and those of Hegel and the Young Hegelians. Howard thus provides a close textual study of Marx’s developing theory and method as it emerges in his confrontation with the Hegelian dialectic.   This systematic study is more than a commentary insofar as it con­centrates on the development of a critical theory, dialectically founded, whose implications affect our perception of contemporary problems and our ability to affect social change today. The interpretation is not orthodox, and is intended to spur both students and teachers to a rethinking of both theory and practice.","author":[{"family":"Howard","given":"Dick"}],"citation-key":"howard1972development","ISBN":"978-0-8093-0559-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["1972"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"238","publisher":"Southern Illinois University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Development of the Marxian Dialectic","type":"book"},{"id":"howard1992marx","abstract":"Analyzes the relation of philosophy and politics, and illustrates this by a reinterpretation of Kant, Hegel and Marx.

Howard's research shows that despite remarkable convergence in their economic, judicial, and social policies, the countries of the European Union still maintain very different definitions of citizenship. Based on an innovative measure of national citizenship policies, the book accounts for both historical variation and contemporary change. Howard's historical explanation highlights the legacies of colonialism and early democratization, which unintentionally created relatively inclusive citizenship regimes. The contemporary analysis explores why some of the more restrictive countries have liberalized in recent decades, whereas others have not. Howard's argument focuses on the politics of citizenship, showing in particular how anti-immigrant public opinion - when activated politically, usually by far right movements or public referenda - can block the liberalizing tendencies of political elites. Overall, the book shows the far-reaching implications of this growing and volatile issue.","author":[{"family":"Howard","given":"Marc Morje"}],"citation-key":"howard2009politics","ISBN":"978-0-521-87077-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",9,7]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"257","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Politics of Citizenship in Europe","type":"book"},{"id":"hryn2004executed","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Hryn","given":"Halyna"}],"citation-key":"hryn2004executed","container-title":"Harvard Ukrainian Studies","ISSN":"0363-5570","issue":"1/4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"page":"67-96","publisher":"[President and Fellows of Harvard College, Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute]","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Executed Renaissance Paradigm Revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/41036862","volume":"27"},{"id":"huber_robust_1964","author":[{"family":"Huber","given":"P.J."}],"citation-key":"huber_robust_1964","container-title":"The Annals of Mathematical Statistics","issued":{"date-parts":[["1964"]]},"language":"en","page":"73-101","title":"Robust estimation of a location parameter","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},{"id":"huber_robust_1977","author":[{"family":"Huber","given":"P.J."}],"citation-key":"huber_robust_1977","event-place":"Philadelphia","issued":{"date-parts":[["1977"]]},"publisher":"Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics","publisher-place":"Philadelphia","title":"Robust Statistical Procedures","type":"book"},{"id":"huber_robust_1981","author":[{"family":"Huber","given":"P.

Most affected by the revelations were the Communist Parties, who had held Stalin in god-like reverence. This thesis examines the effects, both of these revelations on the British Communist Party, and of the second cataclysmic event of that year - the Hungarian Uprising and its suppression by Soviet tanks. It appears that to many members, an opportunity was presented by Khrushchev's frankness, to renew the Communist movement and set aside the old dogmatic ways; this desire for real change did not, unfortunately, permeate the ranks of the British Party leadership. At all points, whilst allowing open debate to proceed, the leadership took positions and expressed views designed to consolidate and continue in the old mould. Demands for a rigorous analysis of the Stalinist period, including the role of the system of democratic centralism, were never fully taken up; the British Party leadership persisted in taking the Khrushchev line - that Stalin, and the cult of the personality, were responsible for the abuses. The questioning of basic Communist principles, such as democratic centralism was not permitted. Considerable debate did take place, however, within the Party press and in the unofficial journal 'The Reasoner', on many topics including Inner-Party Democracy, the rewriting of 'The British Road to Socialism', anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union and unrest in Eastern Europe. The leadership eventually responded to demands for a Special Congress in recognition of the cataclysmic nature of the events. The British Party leadership sought primarily to defend what it knew best - the structures of the Party, and its unthinking loyalty to the Soviet Union. This latter feature proved a heavy strain on the Party when the leadership unconditionally supported the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian Uprising. The combined effect of the events of 1956 led to a membership loss in the region of 7,000. 1956 appears to have been a tragically wasted opportunity for the international Communist movement. Having exposed and rejected the distortions of the Stalin period, the possibilities were not taken up. The man had gone, but the system remained unaltered. This thesis attempts to show, however, that whilst the British Party had been nominally independent since the dissolution of the Comintern in 1943, it was, because of its historical development, psychologically subordinate to Moscow. For the leaders of the British Communist Party to have gone against the Soviet line, no matter how appalling their decisions, no matter now reasonable the arguments of the British Party dissidents, would have been inconceivable. For many British Communists, Marxism-Leninism had become an article of faith, rather than a political philosophy and practical tool; for many others however, the events of 1956 demonstrated that faith and reason could no longer be reconciled. Despite the departure of many, this dichotomy was to remain within the British Communist Party, along with the structures of democratic centralism, until its dissolution in November 1991.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Hudson","given":"Katharine Jane"}],"citation-key":"hudson1992double","genre":"Doctoral","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]},"language":"eng","license":"open","number-of-pages":"360","publisher":"University of London","source":"discovery.ucl.ac.uk","title":"The Double Blow: 1956 and the Communist Party of Great Britain","title-short":"The double blow","type":"thesis","URL":"https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10065583/"},{"id":"hughes2012quantitative","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Hughes","given":"James M."},{"family":"Foti","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Krakauer","given":"David C."},{"family":"Rockmore","given":"Daniel N."}],"citation-key":"hughes2012quantitative","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1115407109","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",5,15]]},"page":"7682-7686","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"Quantitative patterns of stylistic influence in the evolution of literature","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1115407109","volume":"109"},{"id":"hughes2015marxism","abstract":"The collapse of Marxism in much of the Third World as well as Europe was so sudden and spectacular that it is hard to believe that in the space of seven years The Journal of Communist Studies could bring out special issues both on the creation of ‘Military Marxist Regimes in Africa’, and on their demise and the wider collapse of Marxist governments on the continent.

Born to a prosperous mercantile family, he spent his life enjoying the comfortable existence of a Victorian gentleman; yet he was at the same time the co-author of The Communist Manifesto, a ruthless political tactician, and the man who sacrificed his best years so that Karl Marx could have the freedom to write. Although his contributions are frequently overlooked, Engels's grasp of global capital provided an indispensable foundation for communist doctrine, and his account of the Industrial Revolution, The Condition of the Working Class in England, remains one of the most haunting and brutal indictments of capitalism's human cost.Drawing on a wealth of letters and archives, acclaimed historian Tristram Hunt plumbs Engels's intellectual legacy and shows us how one of the great bon viveurs of Victorian Britain reconciled his exuberant personal life with his radical political philosophy. This epic story of devoted friendship, class compromise, ideological struggle, and family betrayal at last brings Engels out from the shadow of his famous friend and collaborator.","author":[{"family":"Hunt","given":"Tristram"}],"citation-key":"hunt2010marx","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-4299-8355-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",8,3]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"469","publisher":"Henry Holt and Company","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Google Books","title":"Marx's General: The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels","title-short":"Marx's General","type":"book"},{"id":"hurd2018hohfeldian","abstract":"Abstract.

In crackling, fast-paced prose, he reveals forgotten episodes that cast American history in a new light. We travel to the Guano Islands, where prospectors collected one of the nineteenth century’s most valuable commodities, and the Philippines, site of the most destructive event on U.S. soil. In Puerto Rico, Immerwahr shows how U.S. doctors conducted grisly experiments they would never have conducted on the mainland and charts the emergence of independence fighters who would shoot up the U.S. Congress.In the years after World War II, Immerwahr notes, the United States moved away from colonialism. Instead, it put innovations in electronics, transportation, and culture to use, devising a new sort of influence that did not require the control of colonies.

Conducting careful readings and translations of recently released documents in Russian, Japanese, and Chinese, Ishikawa Yoshihiro builds a portrait of the party's multifaceted character, revealing the provocative influences that shaped the movement and the ideologies of its competitors.Making use of public and private documents and research, Ishikawa begins the story in 1919 with Chinese intellectuals who wrote extensively under pen names and, in fact, plagiarized or translated many iconic texts of early Chinese Marxism. Chinese Marxists initially drew intellectual sustenance from their Japanese counterparts, until Japan clamped down on leftist activities. The Chinese then turned to American and British sources. Ishikawa traces these networks through an exhaustive survey of journals, newspapers, and other intellectual and popular publications. He reports on numerous early meetings involving a range of groups, only some of which were later funneled into CCP membership, and he follows the developments at Soviet Russian gatherings attended by a number of Chinese representatives who claimed to speak for a nascent CCP. Concluding his narrative in 1922, one year after the party's official founding, Ishikawa clarifies a traditionally opaque period in Chinese history and sheds new light on the subsequent behavior and attitude of the party.","author":[{"family":"Ishikawa","given":"Yoshihiro"}],"citation-key":"ishikawa2012formation","ISBN":"978-0-231-50416-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",11,13]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"619","publisher":"Columbia University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Formation of the Chinese Communist Party","type":"book"},{"id":"israel2014revolutionary","abstract":"How the Radical Enlightenment inspired and shaped the French RevolutionHistorians of the French Revolution used to take for granted what was also obvious to its contemporary observers—that the Revolution was shaped by the radical ideas of the Enlightenment.

In Revolutionary Ideas, one of the world's leading historians of the Enlightenment restores the Revolution’s intellectual history to its rightful central role. Drawing widely on primary sources, Jonathan Israel shows how the Revolution was set in motion by radical eighteenth-century doctrines, how these ideas divided revolutionary leaders into vehemently opposed ideological blocs, and how these clashes drove the turning points of the Revolution.In this compelling account, the French Revolution stands once again as a culmination of the emancipatory and democratic ideals of the Enlightenment.

Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform.Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers.

'Political Economy', a catch-all title which ignored the diversity of viewpoints to be found amongst the discipline's leading proponents, became associated in the popular mind with moral and political forces held to be uniquely conducive to the progress of an increasingly industrialised and competitive society. 'Political Economy' served in turn as the focus for critics of equally diverse moral and political persuasions, who sought to challenge the materialism of contemporary society and offer their own assessments of the profound social changes of the time. In the introductory essay to the collection of readings from such 'critics of capitalism', the editors review the principles of the early economists, the way in which these principles were appropriated and applied by their Victorian successors and the contrasting modes which critics of popular economic ideas assumed. Subsequent extracts from the writings of the Owenite Socialist John Bray, Carlyle, Marx and Engels, J. S. Mill, Ruskin, Arnold, T. H. Green, William Morris and G. B. Shaw, demonstrate both the breadth of the possible grounds for ideological opposition to the prevailing philosophy and the shifting nature of the debate as 'Political Economy' itself was revealed as incapable of explaining or responding to the changing conditions of the 1870s. Headnotes to the extracts describe the genesis of individual debate and discuss distinctive stylistic features. Annotation in the form of footnotes and endnotes has been designed to gloss obscure allusions and arguments. In making more accessible the socio-economic writings of those authors now better known for their imaginative work, this volume will enable readers to reach a more profound appreciation of the central role such work played in developing the moral vision embodied in their more lastingly popular books and essays.","author":[{"family":"Jay","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Jay","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"jay1986critics","event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-0-521-31962-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1986",12,11]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"282","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"Google Books","title":"Critics of Capitalism: Victorian Reactions to 'Political Economy'","title-short":"Critics of Capitalism","type":"book"},{"id":"jelveh2018political","abstract":"Do empirical estimates in economics reflect the political orientation of economists?

We find that although political discourse expressed in books did become more polarized in the late 1990s, polarization remained low relative to the late 19th and much of the 20th century. We also find that polarization of discourse in books predicts legislative gridlock, but polarization of congressional language does not. Using a dynamic panel data set of phrases, we find that polarized phrases increase in frequency in Google Books before their use increases in congressional speech. Our evidence is consistent with an autonomous effect of elite discourse on congressional speech and legislative gridlock, but this effect is not large enough to drive the recent increase in congressional polarization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Jensen","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Naidu","given":"Suresh"},{"family":"Kaplan","given":"Ethan"},{"family":"Wilse-Samson","given":"Laurence"},{"family":"Gergen","given":"David"},{"family":"Zuckerman","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Spirling","given":"Arthur"}],"citation-key":"jensen2012political","container-title":"Brookings Papers on Economic Activity","ISSN":"0007-2303","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"1-81","publisher":"Brookings Institution Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"Political Polarization and the Dynamics of Political Language: Evidence from 130 Years of Partisan Speech [with Comments and Discussion]","title-short":"Political Polarization and the Dynamics of Political Language","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/41825364"},{"id":"jockers2013macroanalysis","author":[{"family":"Jockers","given":"Matthew Lee"}],"citation-key":"jockers2013macroanalysis","event-place":"Urbana","ISBN":"978-0-252-03752-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"publisher":"University of Illinois Press","publisher-place":"Urbana","title":"Macroanalysis: Digital Methods and Literary History","title-short":"Macroanalysis","type":"book"},{"id":"johnson2010cold","author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"A.

What does the turkey we eat on Thanksgiving have to do with the country on the eastern Mediterranean? Can you figure out how much your dinner will cost by counting the words on the menu? In The Language of Food, Stanford University professor and MacArthur Fellow Dan Jurafsky peels away the mysteries from the foods we think we know. Thirteen chapters evoke the joy and discovery of reading a menu dotted with the sharp-eyed annotations of a linguist. Jurafsky points out the subtle meanings hidden in filler words like \"rich\" and \"crispy,\" zeroes in on the metaphors and storytelling tropes we rely on in restaurant reviews, and charts a microuniverse of marketing language on the back of a bag of potato chips. The fascinating journey through The Language of Food uncovers a global atlas of culinary influences. With Jurafsky's insight, words like ketchup, macaron, and even salad become living fossils that contain the patterns of early global exploration that predate our modern fusion-filled world. From ancient recipes preserved in Sumerian song lyrics to colonial shipping routes that first connected East and West, Jurafsky paints a vibrant portrait of how our foods developed. A surprising history of culinary exchange—a sharing of ideas and culture as much as ingredients and flavors—lies just beneath the surface of our daily snacks, soups, and suppers. Engaging and informed, Jurafsky's unique study illuminates an extraordinary network of language, history, and food.

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions.Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.

We contrast this fairness-based perspective with two alternate perspectives: the first focuses on inequality and the causal impact of algorithms and the second on the distribution of power. We formalize these perspectives drawing on techniques from causal inference and empirical economics, and characterize when they give divergent evaluations.

Simple versions of efficiency wage models can explain normal involuntary unemployment, segmented labor markets, and wage differentials across firms and industries for workers with similar productive characteristics. However, deferred payment schemes can solve some efficiency wage problems without requiring job rationing. A wide variety of evidence on interindustry wage differences is analyzed.

The point of departure for this study is the perspective opened up by Victor Cousin in the early 19th-century on 'Eclecticism' and its association with the history of philosophy established by Renaissance scholars. Kelley considers a broad range of topics, including the rivalry between 'ideas' and language, the rise of cultural history, the contributions of certain 19th- and 20th-century practitioners of the history of ideas in interdisciplinary areas of philosophy, literature and the sciences, and finally the current state of intellectual history. The central theme of the book is the interplay between the canon of philosophical thought and the tradition of language and textual study, the divergence of the latter marking the 'descent of ideas' into the realm of cultural history.","author":[{"family":"Kelley","given":"Donald R."}],"citation-key":"kelley2002descent","ISBN":"978-1-351-54510-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"414","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Google Books","title":"The Descent of Ideas: The History of Intellectual History","title-short":"The Descent of Ideas","type":"book"},{"id":"kempthorne_probability_1971","author":[{"family":"Kempthorne","given":"O."},{"family":"Folks","given":"L."}],"citation-key":"kempthorne_probability_1971","event-place":"Ames","issued":{"date-parts":[["1971"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Iowa State University Press","publisher-place":"Ames","title":"Probability, statistics, and data analysis","type":"book"},{"id":"kennedyjr._statistical_1980","author":[{"family":"Kennedy, Jr.","given":"W.J."},{"family":"Gentle","given":"J.E."}],"citation-key":"kennedyjr._statistical_1980","event-place":"New York","issued":{"date-parts":[["1980"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Marcel Dekker, Inc.","publisher-place":"New York","title":"Statistical Computing","type":"book"},{"id":"khoo2010breaking","abstract":"The recent literature on China’s relations with North Vietnam has given insufficient attention to the impact of the Sino-Soviet conflict.

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Kingma","given":"Diederik P."},{"family":"Ba","given":"Jimmy"}],"citation-key":"kingma2017adam","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1412.6980","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,29]]},"number":"arXiv:1412.6980","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization","title-short":"Adam","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980"},{"id":"kiss2006unsupervised","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Kiss","given":"Tibor"},{"family":"Strunk","given":"Jan"}],"citation-key":"kiss2006unsupervised","container-title":"Computational Linguistics","DOI":"10.1162/coli.2006.32.4.485","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"485–525","source":"ACLWeb","title":"Unsupervised Multilingual Sentence Boundary Detection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://aclanthology.org/J06-4003","volume":"32"},{"id":"kitching1994marxism","abstract":"In 1980 Alvin Gouldner identified two traditions of Marxist thought--Marxism as science and Marxism as critique. This book is concerned with the first and by far the most politically influential of those traditions--Marxism as science. It analyzes the claim, first made by Marx and Engels themselves, that Marxism is some kind of hard natural science of society able to identify laws of social development and to provide a scientific guide to revolutionary activity. Marxism and Science breaks new ground by using Wittgensteinian analysis of Marxist discourse to construct a totally different conception of Marxism appropriate to the postmodern world. In this conception, Marxism is a point of view that can be advanced, rationally defended, and made convincing and persuasive to others, but that is as partial in some respects as any other political point of view. Reconceiving Marxism thus requires not only understanding language in a different nonobjectivist way but also adopting a new political practice and program, which the book proceeds to outline. Marxism and Science concludes that, intellectually, Marxism as hard science is fairly obviously and profoundly untenable. But it goes on to argue that the purely intellectual grounds for this claim are much less interesting than the political and psychological purposes that such a claim has always served for Marxists in particular and scientific socialists in general. The most important of these purposes has been to provide a sort of psychological and emotional certitude to set against the overwhelming existential domination of capitalism in the world. Claiming this certitude to be as spurious as the arguments used to sustain it, the author calls upon Marxists and socialists to admit this and accept the doubt and uncertainty that come with a frank avowal of an open and unforeclosed future.","author":[{"family":"Kitching","given":"G.

The cold war was at its most intense during this period, and it was also the time of the dramas of 1956 - Khruschev's critique of Stalin, the Hungarian uprising and the Suez crisis. Then in the 1960s the opening up of new possibilities for radicalism began, leading up to the events of May 1968. The impact of these events on the Party is extensively analysed, drawing on evidence from detailed archival research and many interviews with former activists. Topics covered include: the nature of the Party and its Soviet 'ecology'; its responses to the events of 1956; its involvement in anti-colonial struggles; its positions on international and economic issues and perspectives on class struggle; its relationship with the Labour Party and the trade unions; and the forces for change in the Party in the 1960s. Times change, and John Callaghan's book differs from previous volumes in this series in a number of ways - most obviously, in that it was written after the demise of the Soviet Union and the Party, and thus with much better access to archives and the views of former party members. In addition, it is organised thematically rather than chronologically, and is written from a more critical position than previous titles in the series. It shares with its predecessors, however, the idea that a history of the CPGB has some importance, not least for the light it casts on some of the key issues of the twentieth century.","author":[{"family":"Klugmann","given":"James"},{"family":"Callaghan","given":"John T."}],"citation-key":"klugmann2001cold","ISBN":"978-0-85315-958-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"324","publisher":"Lawrence & Wishart","source":"Google Books","title":"Cold War, Crisis and Conflict: The History of the Communist Party of Great Britain, 1951-68","title-short":"Cold War, Crisis and Conflict","type":"book"},{"id":"knight1921risk","abstract":"Risk, Uncertainty and Profit by Frank Hyneman Knight, first published in 1921, is a rare manuscript, the original residing in one of the great libraries of the world.

However, ideological continuity is an integral part of democratic representation as well. How do parties balance these seemingly conflicting roles? This study combines insights from spatial models of elections and cleavage theory to explain stability and change in European party positions. Embracing the multidimensionality of the policy space, I argue that a party’s reputation and durable party-voter linkages constrain positional change on its more salient, primary dimension. Yet, by remaining ideologically true to its supporters’ key concerns, a party can strategically shift on secondary issues outside of its core agenda. Cross-sectional time series analysis of party positions (1999–2019) across fourteen Western European countries confirms this prediction, especially for small to medium-sized and opposition parties. This finding has important implications for our understanding of party strategy and democratic representation.Supplemental data for this article can be accessed online at: https://doi.org/10.1080/01402382.2021.1915659 .","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Koedam","given":"Jelle"}],"citation-key":"koedam2022change","container-title":"West European Politics","DOI":"10.1080/01402382.2021.1915659","ISSN":"0140-2382","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,7]]},"page":"693-715","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"A change of heart?

His work has implications for contemporary cultural studies that extend far beyond discussions of the practical problems of historical method. He is the foremost exponent and practitioner of Begriffsgeschichte, a methodology of historical studies that focuses on the invention and development of the fundamental concepts underlying and informing a distinctively historical manner of being in the world.  The eighteen essays in this volume illustrate the four theses of Koselleck&#39;s concept of history. First, historical process is marked by a distinctive kind of temporality different from that found in nature. This temporality is multileveled and subject to different rates of acceleration and deceleration, and functions not only as a matrix within which historical events happen but also as a causal force in the determination of social reality in its own right.  Second, historical reality is social reality, an internally differentiated structure of functional relationships in which the rights and interests of one group collide with those of other groups, and lead to the kinds of conflict in which defeat is experienced as an ethical failure requiring reflection on &quot;what went wrong&quot; to determine the historical significance of the conflict itself.  Third, the history of historiography is a history of the evolution of the language of historians. In this respect, Koselleck&#39;s work converges with that of Barthes, Foucault, and Derrida, all of whom stress the status of historiography as discourse rather than as discipline, and feature the constitutive nature of historical discourse as against its claim to literal truthfulness.  Finally, the fourth aspect of Koselleck&#39;s notion of the concept of history is that a properly historicist concept of history is informed by the realization that what we call modernity is nothing more than an aspect of the discovery of history&#39;s concept in our age. The aporias of modernism--in arts and letters as well as in the human and natural sciences--are a function of the discovery of the historicity of both society and knowledge.","author":[{"family":"Koselleck","given":"Reinhart"}],"citation-key":"koselleck2002practice","ISBN":"978-0-8047-4305-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"388","publisher":"Stanford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Practice of Conceptual History: Timing History, Spacing Concepts","title-short":"The Practice of Conceptual History","type":"book"},{"id":"kozlowski2019geometry","abstract":"We argue word embedding models are a useful tool for the study of culture using a historical analysis of shared understandings of social class as an empirical case.

Dimensions induced by word differences (rich – poor) in these spaces correspond to dimensions of cultural meaning, and the projection of words onto these dimensions reflects widely shared associations, which we validate with surveys. Analyzing text from millions of books published over 100 years, we show that the markers of class continuously shifted amidst the economic transformations of the twentieth century, yet the basic cultural dimensions of class remained remarkably stable.

We consider and analyze three approaches of increasing complexity to generate such linguistic property time series, the culmination of which uses distributional characteristics inferred from word co-occurrences. Using recently proposed deep neural language models, we first train vector representations of words for each time period. Second, we warp the vector spaces into one unified coordinate system. Finally, we construct a distance-based distributional time series for each word to track its linguistic displacement over time.

The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to \"travel\" to reach the embedded words of another document. We show that this distance metric can be cast as an instance of the Earth Mover's Distance, a well studied transportation problem for which several highly efficient solvers have been developed.

The importance of class, both as social fact and social symbol, is reflected in their detailed analysis, and emphasis on merit rather than rank, skill rather than status, as keystones of democratic rule.The authors note that power is only one of the values and instruments manifested in interpersonal relations; it cannot be understood in abstraction from other values. Lasswell and Kaplan call for the replacement of \"power politics,\" both in theory and in practice, by a conception in which attention is focused on the human consequences of power as the major concern of both political thought and political action.

Retrospectively, we can hardly imagine the history of Christian thought, and the history of Christianity itself, without the Old Testament. When the Emperor Constantine adopted the Christian faith, his fusion of the Church and the State ensured that the Christian worldview (which by this time had absorbed Jewish ideals that had come to them through the Greek translation) would leave an imprint on subsequent history.

Unsurprisingly, Lefebvre always insisted on the importance of Hegel to understanding Marx. But the imposing Metaphilosophy also suggested the significance he ascribed to Nietzsche, in the 'realm of shadows' through which philosophy seeks to think the world. Lefebvre proposes here that the modern world is at the same time Hegelian in terms of the state; Marxist in terms of the social and society; and Nietzschean in terms of civilization and its values. As early as 1939, Lefebvre pioneered a French reading of Nietzsche that rejected the philosopher's appropriation by fascism, bringing out the tragic implications of Nietzsche's proclamation that 'God is dead' long before this approach was followed by such later writers as Foucault, Derrida and Deleuze. Forty years later, in the last of his philosophical writings, Lefebvre juxtaposes the contributions of the three great thinkers, in a text whose themes remain surprisingly relevant today.","author":[{"family":"Lefebvre","given":"Henri"}],"citation-key":"lefebvre2020hegel","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-78873-375-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,11]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"241","publisher":"Verso Books","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Google Books","title":"Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche: Or the Realm of Shadows","title-short":"Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche","type":"book"},{"id":"legrain_les_1991","author":[{"family":"Legrain","given":"Jean-François"}],"citation-key":"legrain_les_1991","contributor":[{"family":"Chenard","given":"Pierre"}],"ISBN":"978-2-905838-23-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1991"]]},"language":"fr","number-of-pages":"736","publisher":"Centre d'Etudes et de Documentation Economique, Juridique et Sociale","source":"Google Books","title":"Les voix du soulèvement palestinien, 1987-1988: Edition critique des communiqués du Commandement National Unifié du Soulèvement et du Mouvement de la Résistance Islamique.

He attacked republicans for neglecting social depredation in favour of political reform. However, his transition to communism also carried with it several republican commitments. Unlike the many apolitical versions of communism at the time, Marx insisted that the workers had to establish the republic before communism could emerge. He also extended key republican political ideas, including the objection to arbitrary power, to the social sphere. But what was absent was an account of a more participatory and accountable political alternative to the modern republic.</p> <p>However, the experience of ordinary workers carrying out the legislative and public administration of Paris during the Commune, led Marx to return to many of those early republican themes.

Its commitment to popular sovereignty subverts justifications of authority, locating power in the hands of the citizenry who hold the capacity to create, transform, and maintain their political institutions. Republicanism's conception of freedom rejects social, political, and economic structures subordinating citizens to any uncontrolled power - from capitalism and wage-labour to patriarchy and imperialism. It views any such domination as inimical to republican freedom. Moreover, it combines a revolutionary commitment to overturning despotic and tyrannical regimes with the creation of political and economic institutions that realise the sovereignty of all citizens, institutions that are resilient to threats of oligarchical control. This volume is dedicated to retrieving and developing this radical potential, challenging the more conventional moderate conceptions of republicanism. It brings together scholars at the forefront of tracing this radical heritage of the republican tradition, and developing arguments, texts, and practices into a critical and emancipatory body of political and social thought. The volume spans historical discussions of the English Levellers, French and Ottoman revolutionaries, and American abolitionists and trade unionists; explorations of the radical republican aspects of the thought of Machiavelli, Marx, and Rousseau; and theoretical examinations of social domination and popular constitutionalism. It will appeal to political theorists, historians of political thought, and political activists interested in how republicanism provides a robust and successful radical transformation to existing social and political orders.","author":[{"family":"Leipold","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Nabulsi","given":"Karma"},{"family":"White","given":"Stuart"}],"citation-key":"leipold2020radical","event-place":"Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-19-879672-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"277","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford","source":"Google Books","title":"Radical Republicanism: Recovering the Tradition's Popular Heritage","title-short":"Radical Republicanism","type":"book"},{"id":"lemieux2009performance","abstract":"An increasing fraction of jobs in the U.S. labor market explicitly pay workers for their performance using bonus pay, commissions, or piece-rate contracts. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we show that compensation in performance-pay jobs is more closely tied to both observed and unobserved productive characteristics of workers than compensation in non-performance-pay jobs. We also find that the return to these productive characteristics increased faster over time in performance-pay than in non-performance-pay jobs. We show that this finding is consistent with the view that underlying changes in returns to skill due, for instance, to technological change induce more firms to offer performance-pay contracts and result in more wage inequality among workers who are paid for performance. Thus, performance pay provides a channel through which underlying changes in returns to skill get translated into higher wage inequality. We conclude that this channel accounts for 21% of the growth in the variance of male wages between the late 1970s and the early 1990s and for most of the increase in wage inequality above the eightieth percentile over the same period.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Lemieux","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Macleod","given":"W.

Many more were never convicted, but are nonetheless subject to surveillance by the state. Never before has the American government maintained so vast a network of institutions dedicated solely to the control and confinement of its citizens. A provocative assessment of the contemporary carceral state for American democracy, Arresting Citizenship argues that the broad reach of the criminal justice system has fundamentally recast the relation between citizen and state, resulting in a sizable—and growing—group of second-class citizens. From police stops to court cases and incarceration, at each stage of the criminal justice system individuals belonging to this disempowered group come to experience a state-within-a-state that reflects few of the country’s core democratic values. Through scores of interviews, along with analyses of survey data, Amy E. Lerman and Vesla M. Weaver show how this contact with police, courts, and prisons decreases faith in the capacity of American political institutions to respond to citizens’ concerns and diminishes the sense of full and equal citizenship—even for those who have not been found guilty of any crime. The effects of this increasingly frequent contact with the criminal justice system are wide-ranging—and pernicious—and Lerman and Weaver go on to offer concrete proposals for reforms to reincorporate this large group of citizens as active participants in American civic and political life.","author":[{"family":"Lerman","given":"Amy E."},{"family":"Weaver","given":"Vesla M."}],"citation-key":"lerman2014arresting","ISBN":"978-0-226-13797-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,6]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"343","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Arresting Citizenship: The Democratic Consequences of American Crime Control","title-short":"Arresting Citizenship","type":"book"},{"id":"leskovec2014mining","abstract":"Written by leading authorities in database and Web technologies, this book is essential reading for students and practitioners alike.

Its purpose is to explore the relationship between Hegel and Marx; to define the relationship between Hegel and Engels; and to distinguish between the theories of Marxism and Engelsism. Marx used Feuerbach towards the critique and ultimate transformation of Hegel's phenomenology and humanism. This transformation, which cut out Hegel's idealism by identifying the environment in which people produced their sustenance as the subject of history, marks the genesis of historical materialism. Marx continued to use Hegel's logical categories. In chapter three of Divergent Paths, Norman Levine conducts an in depth study of Marx's 1841 doctoral dissertation, The Difference Between Democritus' and Epicurus' Philosophy of Nature. It is the center of gravity and controversy of Levine's study. Placed alongside Hegel's Philosophy of History, Levine isolates the categories Marx appropriated from Hegel to show, conclusively, that Marx was not a dialectical materialist. Levine then claims that Engels totally distorted the Hegelian legacy, and this debasement is enshrined in his 1887 essay 'Ludwig Feuerbach and The End of Classical German Philosophy.' Levine brilliantly locates Marxism as the theory of Marx, and Engelsism the theory of Engels. According to Levine both embodied a separate view of history and society, and their contradictions are expressive, in part, of their divergent receptions of Hegel. This is an analysis like no other published to date with two more volumes planned.

On the one level, Bismarck and his supporters fought energetically to annihilate the party with the passage of the Socialist Law (October 21, 1878). After some initial faltering steps, the Social Democrats found a firm footing and struggled successfully to preserve their political existence. The movement was preserved, even though the party organization, its affiliates and its newspapers were suppressed. On another level, the Social Democrats faced an ideological challenge. Their political suppression broadly paralleled the emergence of a conservative socialism which flourished for a short time in a variety of forms. Whatever clothing it wore, conservative socialism aimed to undermine the growing appeal of Social Democracy to the working-men of Germany. A theory of State Socialism was the most attractive garment designed by conservative social thought. The response of the Social Democratic Party to the various facets of this conservative socialism is a significant chapter in the history of the German socialist movement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Lidtke","given":"Vernon L."}],"citation-key":"lidtke1964german","container-title":"International Review of Social History","DOI":"10.1017/S0020859000002534","ISSN":"1469-512X, 0020-8590","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1964",8]]},"language":"en","page":"202-225","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"German Social Democracy and German State Socialism, 1876–1884","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-review-of-social-history/article/german-social-democracy-and-german-state-socialism-18761884/5421CBA13C66345CDEFEA8ED8F130C51","volume":"9"},{"id":"liebich1982origins","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Liebich","given":"André"}],"citation-key":"liebich1982origins","container-title":"Political Theory","ISSN":"0090-5917","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1982"]]},"page":"77-93","publisher":"Sage Publications, Inc.","source":"JSTOR","title":"On the Origins of a Marxist Theory of Bureaucracy in the Critique of Hegel's `Philosophy of Right'","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/190856","volume":"10"},{"id":"lieblein_statistical_1956","author":[{"family":"Lieblein","given":"J."},{"family":"Zelen","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"lieblein_statistical_1956","container-title":"Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards","issued":{"date-parts":[["1956"]]},"language":"en","page":"273-316","title":"Statistical investigation of the fatigue life of deep groove ball bearings","type":"article-journal","volume":"57"},{"id":"liedman2018world","abstract":"The globalised world of the twenty-first century has many parallels with that of the period running up to the cataclysm of 1914, namely the world predicted by Karl Marx.

Money circulates in a never-ceasing torrent, poverty lives side by side with wealth, and capital exercises its impersonal power over each and every one of us.

This substantial new commentary, based on contemporary Russian- and German-language sources, provides hitherto unavailable contextual information that undermines these views and shows how Lenin's argument rests squarely on an optimistic confidence in the workers' revolutionary inclinations and on his admiration of German Social Democracy in particular.

Lenin was the leader of the communist Bolshevik party during the October 1917 revolution in Russia, and he subsequently headed the Soviet state until 1924, bringing stability to the region and establishing a socialist economic and political system. In Lenin, Lars T. Lih presents a striking new interpretation of Lenin’s political beliefs and strategies. Until now, Lenin has been portrayed as a pessimist with a dismissive view of the revolutionary potential of the workers. However, Lih reveals that underneath the sharp polemics, Lenin was actually a romantic enthusiast rather than a sour pragmatist, one who imposed meaning on the whirlwind of events going on around him. This concise and unique biography is based on wide-ranging new research that puts Lenin into the context both of Russian society and of the international socialist movement of the early twentieth century. It also sets the development of Lenin’s political outlook firmly within the framework of his family background and private life. In addition, the book’s images, which are taken from contemporary photographs, posters, and drawings, illustrate the features of Lenin’s world and time.

Republicanism conceives of domination as inherently detrimental to freedom. Republican antitrust considers antitrust law as an “institution of antipower,” aimed at dispersing economic power. This paper sets out two key challenges to the Neo-Brandeisian reform agenda and argues for legal formalism to address them. First, republicanism would alter the normative justification, but not necessarily the content of antitrust law. Neoclassical antitrust law does not broadly reflect a Schumpeterian endorsement of dominance. Rather, its epistemological priors and methodology entail skepticism about the mere presence of economic power. Thus, mainstream antitrust law and policy remain unfazed by the Neo-Brandeisian claim that antitrust should target domination instead of consumer welfare. Second, Neo-Brandeisian reform proposals are inherently polycentric. How Neo-Brandeisians aim to balance distinct values including the competitive process, the harm of concentrated power, and the protection of democracy and egalitarianism has remained unclear. This paper argues that both challenges demand for a formalistic approach to Neo-Brandeisian antitrust. Compared to a case-by-case approach, adopting general rules through legislative or administrative decision-making may legitimately overturn current precedent, incorporate alternate methods of measuring power and competitive harm, and pursue a variety of republican goals. Neo-Brandeisian formalism would essentially reinvigorate the Harvard school’s insight that multiple purposes—including both efficiency and republican liberty—can be attained by formalistic rules.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Lindeboom","given":"Justin"}],"citation-key":"lindeboom2023two","container-title":"The Antitrust Bulletin","DOI":"10.1177/0003603X231180251","ISSN":"0003-603X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"392-410","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Two Challenges for Neo-Brandeisian Antitrust","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0003603X231180251","volume":"68"},{"id":"lindgren_statistical_1976","author":[{"family":"Lindgren","given":"B.W."}],"citation-key":"lindgren_statistical_1976","edition":"3rd","event-place":"New York","issued":{"date-parts":[["1976"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Macmillan","publisher-place":"New York","title":"Statistical theory","type":"book"},{"id":"liu2000tokens","abstract":"The problem of translation has become increasingly central to critical reflections on modernity and its universalizing processes. Approaching translation as a symbolic and material exchange among peoples and civilizations—and not as a purely linguistic or literary matter, the essays in Tokens of Exchange focus on China and its interactions with the West to historicize an economy of translation. Rejecting the familiar regional approach to non-Western societies, contributors contend that “national histories” and “world history” must be read with absolute attention to the types of epistemological translatability that have been constructed among the various languages and cultures in modern times.By studying the production and circulation of meaning as value in areas including history, religion, language, law, visual art, music, and pedagogy, essays consider exchanges between Jesuit and Protestant missionaries and the Chinese between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries and focus on the interchanges occasioned by the spread of capitalism and imperialism. Concentrating on ideological reciprocity and nonreciprocity in science, medicine, and cultural pathologies, contributors also posit that such exchanges often lead to racialized and essentialized ideas about culture, sexuality, and nation. The collection turns to the role of language itself as a site of the universalization of knowledge in its contemplation of such processes as the invention of Basic English and the global teaching of the English language. By focusing on the moments wherein meaning-value is exchanged in the translation from one language to another, the essays highlight the circulation of the global in the local as they address the role played by historical translation in the universalizing processes of modernity and globalization.The collection will engage students and scholars of global cultural processes, Chinese studies, world history, literary studies, history of science, and anthropology, as well as cultural and postcolonial studies.Contributors.

Properly understood, domination is a great evil, the suffering of which ought to be minimized so far as possible. Surprisingly, however, political and social theorists have failed to provide a detailed analysis of the concept of domination in general. This study aims to redress this lacuna. It argues first, that domination should be understood as a condition experienced by persons or groups to the extent that they are dependent on a social relationship in which some other person or group wields arbitrary power over them; this is termed the 'arbitrary power conception' of domination. It argues second, that we should regard it as wrong to perpetrate or permit unnecessary domination and, thus, that as a matter of justice the political and social institutions and practices of any society should be organized so as to minimize avoidable domination; this is termed 'justice as minimizing domination', a conception of social justice that connects with more familiar civic republican accounts of freedom as non-domination. In developing these arguments, this study employs a variety of methodological techniques - including conceptual analysis, formal modelling, social theory, and moral philosophy; existing accounts of dependency, power, social convention, and so on are clarified, expanded, or revised along the way. While of special interest to contemporary civic republicans, this study should appeal to a broad audience with diverse methodological and substantive interests.","author":[{"family":"Lovett","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"lovett2010general","ISBN":"978-0-19-161472-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",5,13]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"284","publisher":"OUP Oxford","source":"Google Books","title":"A General Theory of Domination and Justice","type":"book"},{"id":"lovett2022wellordered","abstract":"Classical and contemporary republicans offer a compelling political vision built on a commitment to promoting freedom from domination, establishing popular control over public officials, and securing the empire of law. The Well-Ordered Republic provides the most rigorous, comprehensive, and up-to-date account of republican political theory presently available, while also showing how that theory can be extended to address new issues of economic justice, workplace democracy, identity politics, emergency powers, education, migration, and foreign policy. Frank Lovett argues that our shared freedom from domination is constituted by republican institutions such as democracy, the rule of law, and the public provision of an unconditional basic income. As a public good whose continued supply depends on robust civic engagement, republican freedom is a valuable but ongoing collective achievement: all citizens must remain dedicated to shared republican institutions for their freedom toendure.

Why did the idea of market freedom hold so little appeal before the modern period and how can we explain its rise to dominance?

After analyzing the ethical core and exploring the conceptual complexity of republican freedom, MacGilvray shows how this way of thinking was confronted with, altered in response to, and finally overcome by the rise of modern market societies.

With spirited argument, MacGregor demonstrates that Hegelian logic suited Marx’s purpose so well because it already contained the unique elements that later appeared in Marx’s social theory, including the notions of surplus value and the transition to communism. The most exciting thing about the book is the clear demonstration that the mature Marx gets ever closer to Hegel, and is increasingly indebted to him. In short, the author gives us a new Hegel and a new Marx. In a manner both original and penetrating, MacGregor shows that dialectical logic is pre-eminently social logic, a reconstruction in thought of social relationships and social structure. Central to the work is the examination of the Philosophy of Right, in which Hegel delineated a theory of modern capitalist society. MacGregor provides a compelling analysis of Hegel’s importance for Lenin and a strong caveat that contemporary Marxism ignores Hegel to its own peril. MacGregor establishes that Hegel’s absolute idealism is founded on a theory of the dialectics of labour similar to Marx’s historical materialism. Another significant discovery elucidates Hegel’s concept of poverty as the missing link which joins Marx’s formulation to classical liberal theory.","author":[{"family":"MacGregor","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"macgregor2015communist","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-317-48514-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",4,24]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"323","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"London","source":"Google Books","title":"The Communist Ideal in Hegel and Marx","type":"book"},{"id":"mackerras2015marxism","abstract":"Marxism is a theory which originated in the context of nineteenth-century industrialised Europe.

The approach described in this paper is based on the view that graphical presentations are sentences of graphical languages. The graphic design issues are codified as expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for graphical languages. Expressiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language can express the desired information. Effectiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language exploits the capabilities of the output medium and the human visual system. A wide variety of designs can be systematically generated by using a composition algebra that composes a small set of primitive graphical languages.

However in Marx’s time, many competing sociological traditions and socialist political movements espoused similar ideas from different origin points. How did Marx emerge as preeminent? We hypothesize that the 1917 Russian Revolution is responsible for elevating Marx’s fame and intellectual following above his contemporary competitors. Using the synthetic control method and Google Ngram data, we construct a synthetic counterfactual for Marx’s citation patterns. This allows us to predict how often Marx would have been cited if the Russian Revolution had not happened.

Joining the Bolsheviks on the eve of the 1917 revolution he played a vital role as Lenin’s right-hand man in the insurrection and went on to lead the Red Army to victory in the ensuing civil war. Having lost to Stalin the struggle for power which followed Lenin’s death, he became an implacable opponent of the dictator over the next three decades—a stance which cost him his political career, his citizenship and ultimately his life. A charismatic orator, a prolific author and a political philosopher whose ideas continue to resonate in the wake of the collapse of the Stalinist regimes of Eastern Europe, Trotsky made an indelible mark on world history.Ernest Mandel, one of the foremost leaders of the international movement which Trotsky founded before the Second World War and an influential economist and political theorist, is uniquely placed to review the life and work of Trotsky. In Trotsky as Alternative he presents a portrait of his subject which is appreciative yet critical. He shows that Trotsky’s contribution to the history of the twentieth century was primarily political rather than sociological, and this in a practical as well as a theoretical sense. He locates Trotsky’s theory of uneven and combined development as a crucial tool whose explanatory power of the mechanisms of world imperialism is as relevant to the late capitalism of the 1990s as it was to the first three decades of the century when it was formulated.Ranging across Trotsky’s struggles against Stalin’s bureaucracy, his formulation of an alternative economic strategy, his theories relating to the Third World, fascism and the national question, his extensive literary criticism, and concluding with a moving assessment of an extraordinary life, this book is a fitting testimony to a man who, in Mandel’s words, “will be judged by history as the most important strategist for the socialist movement.”","author":[{"family":"Mandel","given":"Ernest"}],"citation-key":"mandel1992trotsky","ISBN":"978-1-85984-085-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"198","publisher":"Verso","source":"Google Books","title":"Trotsky as Alternative","type":"book"},{"id":"manekin2012waging","abstract":"Theories of violence against civilians in conflict have tended to view combatants in homogenous terms, as the obedient pawns of military elites, or as uniformly prone to violence due to passionate emotions or economic opportunism. In contrast, this study shows that combatant participation in violence is variable: While in some circumstances soldiers embrace violence eagerly, in others they attempt to shirk it or refuse to commit it outright. What accounts for this variation in violence and restraint? Why are some individuals, and some combat units, more likely to act violently than others? This dissertation examines these questions through a study of Israeli soldiers in the Second Intifada, employing interview, survey, and observational data. The core argument is that variation in combatant violence and restraint is a consequence of organizational control within the military. Drawing on theories in organizational and management studies, I define organizational control broadly to include not only formal mechanisms such as rules, discipline, and enforcement, but also informal mechanisms, such as the inculcation of values, norms, and beliefs through training and leadership. Through organizational control, the military seeks to align the preferences and beliefs of combatants regarding the use of violence with those of military leaders, ensuring that combatants both produce the violence demanded of them (strategic violence) and at the same time do not surpass or subvert such violence so that it no longer serves military interests but their own (opportunistic violence). I show that effective organizational control leads to participation patterns consistent with the preferences of armed group leaders - maximal participation in strategic violence and minimal participation in opportunistic violence. In contrast, weak control leads to participation patterns inconsistent with the preferences of armed group leaders - reduced participation in strategic violence and increased participation in opportunistic violence. When leader preferences are uncertain and control is ambiguous, new, entrepreneurial forms of violence emerge from the military's lower levels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Manekin","given":"Devorah Sarah"}],"citation-key":"manekin2012waging","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"UCLA","source":"escholarship.org","title":"Waging War among Civilians: The Production and Restraint of Counterinsurgent Violence in the Second Intifada","title-short":"Waging War among Civilians","type":"thesis","URL":"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5rg476mq"},{"id":"manly_multivariate_1986","author":[{"family":"Manly","given":"B.F.J."}],"citation-key":"manly_multivariate_1986","event-place":"London","issued":{"date-parts":[["1986"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Chapman and","publisher-place":"London","title":"Multivariate statistical methods: A primer","type":"book"},{"id":"march1957measurement","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"March","given":"James G."}],"citation-key":"march1957measurement","container-title":"The Journal of Politics","DOI":"10.2307/2127196","ISSN":"0022-3816","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1957"]]},"page":"202-226","publisher":"[University of Chicago Press, Southern Political Science Association]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Measurement Concepts in the Theory of Influence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2127196","volume":"19"},{"id":"markell2008insufficiency","abstract":"This essay argues that the neo-Roman republican principle of ?non-domination,? as developed in the recent work of Philip Pettit, cannot serve as a single over-arching political ideal, because it responds to only one of two important dimensions of concern about human agency.

In this book, John Markoff addresses the ways in which insurrectionary peasants and revolutionary legislators joined in bringing the time of the lords to an end and how, in that ending, seigneurial rights came to be central to the very sense of the Revolution. He traces the interaction of peasants and legislators, showing how they confronted, challenged, and implicitly negotiated with one another during the course of events.Contrary to many historians who see the source of revolutionary change in elite culture, Markoff argues that peasant insurrection was a crucial element of the transformation of France. Of particular importance to the study is Markoff's analysis of the unique cahiers de doléances, the lists of grievances drawn up in 1789 by rural communities, urban notables, and nobles alike. These documents are invaluable for understanding the Revolution, but until the pioneering work of Markoff and Gilbert Shapiro, they had not been studied systematically at the national level. In addition to an unprecedented quantitative analysis of the cahiers, Markoff traces the ebb and flow of peasant insurrection across half a decade of revolutionary turbulence. He also offers qualitative analysis through his use of the records of the legislative debates as well as the memoirs and journals of the legislators. The Abolition of Feudalism breaks new ground in charting patterns of grievance and revolt in one of the most important social and political upheavals in history.","author":[{"family":"Markoff","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"markoff1996abolition","ISBN":"978-0-271-01539-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"689","publisher":"Pennsylvania State University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Abolition of Feudalism: Peasants, Lords, and Legislators in the French Revolution","title-short":"The Abolition of Feudalism","type":"book"},{"id":"markowitz_meanvariance_1987","author":[{"family":"Markowitz","given":"H."}],"citation-key":"markowitz_meanvariance_1987","event-place":"Oxford","issued":{"date-parts":[["1987"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Basil Blackwell","publisher-place":"Oxford","title":"Mean-variance analysis in portfolio choice and capital markets","type":"book"},{"id":"martin2009social","abstract":"Social Structures is a book that examines how structural forms spontaneously arise from social relationships. Offering major insights into the building blocks of social life, it identifies which locally emergent structures have the capacity to grow into larger ones and shows how structural tendencies associated with smaller structures shape and constrain patterns of larger structures. The book then investigates the role such structures have played in the emergence of the modern nation-state. Bringing together the latest findings in sociology, anthropology, political science, and history, John Levi Martin traces how sets of interpersonal relationships become ordered in different ways to form structures. He looks at a range of social structures, from smaller ones like families and street gangs to larger ones such as communes and, ultimately, nation-states. He finds that the relationships best suited to forming larger structures are those that thrive in conditions of inequality; that are incomplete and as sparse as possible, and thereby avoid the problem of completion in which interacting members are required to establish too many relationships; and that abhor transitivity rather than assuming it. Social Structures argues that these \"patronage\" relationships, which often serve as means of loose coordination in the absence of strong states, are nevertheless the scaffolding of the social structures most distinctive to the modern state, namely the command army and the political party.","author":[{"family":"Martin","given":"John Levi"}],"citation-key":"martin2009social","ISBN":"978-1-4008-3053-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",7,27]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"409","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Social Structures","type":"book"},{"id":"marx1845thesen","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Marx","given":"Karl"}],"citation-key":"marx1845thesen","event-place":"Stuttgart","issued":{"date-parts":[["1845"]]},"language":"de","publisher":"J.

One proposed remedy is to use economics rather than legislation to address privacy risks by creating a marketplace for privacy where website visitors would choose to accept or reject offers for small payments in exchange for loss of privacy. The notion of micropayments for privacy has not been realized in practice, perhaps because advertisers might be willing to pay a penny per name and IP address, yet few people would sell their contact information for only a penny. 1 In this paper we contend that the time to read privacy policies is, in and of itself, a form of payment. Instead of receiving payments to reveal information, website visitors must pay with their time to research policies in order to retain their privacy. We pose the question: if website users were to read the privacy policy for each site they visit just once a year, what would their time be worth? Aleecia M.

I/S: A JOURNAL OF LAW AND POLICY Studies show privacy policies are hard to read, read infrequently, and do not support rational decision making. We calculated the average time to read privacy policies in two ways. First, we used a list of the 75 most popular websites and assumed an average reading rate of 250 words per minute to find an average reading time of lo minutes per policy. Second, we conducted an online study of 212 participants to measure time to skim online privacy policies and respond to simple comprehension questions. We used data from Nielsen/Net Ratings to estimate the number of unique websites the average Internet user visits annually with a lower bound of 119 sites. We estimated the total number of Americans online based on Pew Internet & American Life data and Census data. Finally, we estimated the value of time as 25% of average hourly salary for leisure and twice wages for time at work. We present a range of values, and found the national opportunity cost for just the time to read policies is on the order of $781 billion. Additional time for comparing policies between multiple sites in order to make informed decisions about privacy brings the social cost well above the market for online advertising. Given that web users also have some value for their privacy on top of the time it takes to read policies, this suggests that under the current self-regulation framework, targeted online advertising may have negative social utility.

McWhorter shows not only how the idea of language as a lens fails but also why we want so badly to believe it: we're eager to celebrate diversity by acknowledging the intelligence of peoples who may not think like we do.

He forcefully underlined that all this is not some 'fatality of nature' - as indeed as the structural antagonisms of capital are characteristically misrepresented, so as to leave them in their place - but a form of self-alienation. In other words, not the deed of an all-powerful outside agency, natural or metaphysical, but the outcome of a determinate type of historical development which can be positively altered by a conscious intervention in the historical process, in order to 'transcend labour's self-alienation'.\"--Preface.","author":[{"family":"Mészáros","given":"István"}],"citation-key":"meszaros_marxs_1970","ISBN":"978-0-85036-554-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1970"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"364","publisher":"Merlin","source":"Google Books","title":"Marx's Theory of Alienation","type":"book"},{"id":"metropolis_equations_1953","author":[{"family":"Metropolis","given":"N."},{"family":"Rosenbluth","given":"A.W."},{"family":"Rosenbluth","given":"M.N."},{"family":"Teller","given":"A.H."},{"family":"Teller","given":"E."}],"citation-key":"metropolis_equations_1953","container-title":"Journal of Chemical Physics","issued":{"date-parts":[["1953"]]},"page":"1087-1091","title":"Equations of state calculations by fast computing machines","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},{"id":"meyer_introductory_1970","author":[{"family":"Meyer","given":"P.L."}],"citation-key":"meyer_introductory_1970","edition":"2nd","event-place":"Reading","issued":{"date-parts":[["1970"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Addison-Wesley","publisher-place":"Reading","title":"Introductory probability and statistical applications","type":"book"},{"id":"meyer2000matrix","abstract":"This book avoids the traditional definition-theorem-proof format; instead a fresh approach introduces a variety of problems and examples all in a clear and informal style.

An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of \"Canada\" and \"Air\" cannot be easily combined to obtain \"Air Canada\".

These have long congealed into the Marxist theory of the state, or into the Marxist- Leninist theory of the state, but they cannot be taken to constitute an adequate expression of Marx's own views. This is not because these theories bear no relation to Marx's views but rather that they emphasize some aspects of his thought to the detriment of others, and thus distort by over-simplification an extremely complex and by no means unambiguous body of ideas; and also that they altogether ignore certain strands in Marx's thought which are of considerable interest and importance. This does not, in itself, make later views better or worse than Marx's own: to decide this, what needs to be compared is not text with text, but text with historical or contemporary reality itself. This can hardly be done within the compass of an essay. But Marx is so inescapably bound up with contemporary politics, his thought is so deeply buried inside the shell of official Marxism and his name is so often invoked in ignorance by enemies and partisans alike, that it is worth asking again what he, rather than Engels, or Lenin or any other of his followers, disciples or critics, actually said and appeared to think about the state.

As Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter fought for the presidency in late 1976, the superpower struggle overseas seemed to take a backseat to more contentious domestic issues of race relations and rising unemployment. There was one continent, however, where the Cold War was on the point of flaring hot: Africa. \n\nJimmy Carter in Africa opens just after Henry Kissinger's failed 1975 plot in Angola, as Carter launches his presidential campaign. The Civil Rights Act was only a decade old, and issues of racial justice remained contentious. Racism at home undermined Americans' efforts to win hearts and minds abroad and provided potent propaganda to the Kremlin. As President Carter confronted Africa, the essence of American foreign policy—stopping Soviet expansion—slammed up against the most explosive and raw aspect of American domestic politics—racism.\n\nDrawing on candid interviews with Carter, as well as key U.S. and foreign diplomats, and on a dazzling array of international archival sources, Nancy Mitchell offers a timely reevaluation of the Carter administration and of the man himself. In the face of two major tests, in Rhodesia and the Horn of Africa, Carter grappled with questions of Cold War competition, domestic politics, personal loyalty, and decision-making style. Mitchell reveals an administration not beset by weakness and indecision, as is too commonly assumed, but rather constrained by Cold War dynamics and by the president's own temperament as he wrestled with a divided public and his own human failings. Jimmy Carter in Africa presents a stark portrait of how deeply Cold War politics and racial justice were intertwined.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Nancy"}],"citation-key":"mitchell2016jimmy","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","title":"Jimmy Carter in Africa: Race and the Cold War","title-short":"Jimmy Carter in Africa","type":"book","URL":"http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=25540"},{"id":"mitchell2021algorithmic","abstract":"A recent wave of research has attempted to define fairness quantitatively.

This article attempts to bring much-needed order. First, we explicate the various choices and assumptions made—often implicitly—to justify the use of prediction-based decision-making. Next, we show how such choices and assumptions can raise fairness concerns and we present a notationally consistent catalog of fairness definitions from the literature.

He made three successive different interpretations of the revolution of 1848 and the Paris Commune, but that does not make his politics merely circumstantial. There are contradictions between texts and within texts, but some explanations are more robust, some determinations more fundamental, and some historical formulations more balanced than others. His texts must be read as part of a corpus and understood in historical context, particularly in relation to the working-class movement that gave unity to his life and thought, for it is in the texts and formulations that engage with the working-class movement that Marx is the most illuminating. Conversely, it is when he loses touch with the movement - either when he takes up an ultra-revolutionary position, as in 1849-50 or, in reaction to its failure, a detached objectivism as in 1851-52 - that his vision becomes skewed and distorted. The first of these mistakes was subjectivist - the belief that all was made possible by political will; the second was objectivist - the belief that human action could not change the immutable laws of history. These deviations occurred because of the disintegration of the social democratic movement with which Marx identified, particularly in Germany; but the subjectivist one, amazingly enough, prefigured the future, both the Paris Commune and 1917.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Moss","given":"Bernard"}],"citation-key":"moss1998marx","container-title":"Socialist Register","ISSN":"0081-0606","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",3,18]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c)","source":"socialistregister.com","title":"Marx and the Permanent Revolution in France: Background to the Communist Manifesto","title-short":"Marx and the Permanent Revolution in France","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5704","volume":"34"},{"id":"mosteller1964inference","abstract":"The 1964 publication of Inference and Disputed Authorship made the cover of Time magazine and the attention of academics and the public alike for its use of statistical methodology to solve one of American history’s most notorious questions: the disputed authorship of the Federalist Papers.

This extends to information foraging, where a knowledge-seeker shifts between reading in depth and studying new domains. To study this decision-making process, we examine the reading choices made by one of the most celebrated scientists of the modern era: Charles Darwin. From the full-text of books listed in his chronologically-organized reading journals, we generate topic models to quantify his local (text-to-text) and global (text-to-past) reading decisions using Kullback-Liebler Divergence, a cognitively-validated, information-theoretic measure of relative surprise. Rather than a pattern of surprise-minimization, corresponding to a pure exploitation strategy, Darwin’s behavior shifts from early exploitation to later exploration, seeking unusually high levels of cognitive surprise relative to previous eras. These shifts, detected by an unsupervised Bayesian model, correlate with major intellectual epochs of his career as identified both by qualitative scholarship and Darwin’s own self-commentary. Our methods allow us to compare his consumption of texts with their publication order. We find Darwin’s consumption more exploratory than the culture’s production, suggesting that underneath gradual societal changes are the explorations of individual synthesis and discovery. Our quantitative methods advance the study of cognitive search through a framework for testing interactions between individual and collective behavior and between short- and long-term consumption choices. This novel application of topic modeling to characterize individual reading complements widespread studies of collective scientific behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Murdock","given":"Jaimie"},{"family":"Allen","given":"Colin"},{"family":"DeDeo","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"murdock2017exploration","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2016.11.012","ISSN":"0010-0277","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"117-126","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Exploration and exploitation of Victorian science in Darwin’s reading notebooks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027716302840","volume":"159"},{"id":"murdock2018development","abstract":"From 1837, when he returned to England aboard the $\\textit{HMS Beagle}$, to 1860, just after publication of $\\textit{The Origin of Species}$, Charles Darwin kept detailed notes of each book he read or wanted to read.

One hundred and sixty years after it was written, the Manifesto of the Communist Party is celebrated as the text which contains the most formidable prediction of capitalist development on a world scale. This article considers how the writings of Marx and Engels were translated and assimilated in Italy, from its first appearance in 1889 to 1945 and, more generally, explores the misinterpretations of the fortune of Marx's works in Italy. From a close examination of the press of the newly established workers' movement and the first socialist writings, the reality of a counterfeited and theoretically impoverished 'Marxism' emerges. Antonio Labriola's Essays on the Materialist Conception of History, which were published between 1895 and 1897, were the only works in Italy that offered a rigorous interpretation capable of measuring up to the European levels of Marxism. Through the historiographical reconstruction of translated works and the development of the interpretations of Marx and Engels' The Communist Manifesto, this article considers the debate on the 'crisis of Marxism' of the late 19th century in which Benedetto Croce was the most important figure, the limitations of the diffusion of Marx's theories in the Italian Socialist Party, the struggle between reformist and the union-revolutionary revisionism of the early 20th century and the repression of 20 years of fascism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Musto","given":"Marcello"}],"citation-key":"musto2008dissemination","container-title":"Critique","DOI":"10.1080/03017600802434243","ISSN":"0301-7605","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",12,1]]},"page":"445-456","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Dissemination and Reception of The Communist Manifesto in Italy: From the Origins to 1945","title-short":"Dissemination and Reception of The Communist Manifesto in Italy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03017600802434243","volume":"36"},{"id":"musto2008karl","abstract":"Written between 1857 and 1858, the Grundrisse is the first draft of Marx's critique of political economy and, thus, also the initial preparatory work on Capital.

In this collection, various international experts in the field, analysing the Grundrisse on the 150th anniversary of its composition, present a Marx in many ways radically different from the one who figures in the dominant currents of twentieth-century Marxism. The book demonstrates the relevance of the Grundrisse to an understanding of Capital and of Marx's theoretical project as a whole, which, as is well known, remained uncompleted. It also highlights the continuing explanatory power of Marxian categories for contemporary society and its present contradictions.

In the context of what some commentators have described as a \"Marx renaissance\", the aim of this book is to make a close study of Marx's principal writings in relation to the major problems of our own society, and to show why and how some of his theories constitute a precious tool for the understanding and critique of the world in the early twenty-first century. The book brings together varied reflections on the Marxian oeuvre, drawing on different perspectives and fields, and argues its case in two different parts. The first will encompass such diverse areas and themes as political thought, economics, nationalism, ethnicity, post-capitalist society, freedom, democracy, emancipation, and alienation, showing in each case how Marx has still today an invaluable contribution to make. The second presents a complete and rigorous account of the dissemination and the reception of Marx’s work throughout the world in the last decade.

However, the international economic crisis of 2008 favoured a return to his analysis of capitalism, and recently published volumes of the Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe (MEGA2) have provided researchers with new texts that underline the gulf between Marx's critical theory and the dogmatism of many twentieth-century Marxisms. This work reconstructs with great textual and historical rigour, but in a form accessible to those encountering Marx for the first time, a number of little noted, or often misunderstood, stages in his intellectual biography. The book is divided into three parts. The first – 'Intellectual Influences and Early Writings' – investigates the formation of the young Marx and the composition of his Parisian manuscripts of 1844. The second – 'The Critique of Political Economy' – focuses on the genesis of Marx's magnum opus, beginning with his studies of political economy in the early 1850s and following his labours through to all the preparatory manuscripts for Capital. The third – 'Political Militancy' – presents an insightful history of the International Working Men's Association and of the role that Marx played in that organization. The volume offers a close and innovative examination of Marx's ideas on post-Hegelian philosophy, alienated labour, the materialist conception of history, research methods, the theory of surplus-value, working-class self-emancipation, political organization and revolutionary theory. From this emerges “another Marx”, a thinker very different from the one depicted by so many of his critics and ostensible disciples.","author":[{"family":"Musto","given":"Marcello"}],"citation-key":"musto2018another","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-4742-6734-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,3]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"289","publisher":"Bloomsbury","publisher-place":"London","source":"Google Books","title":"Another Marx: Early Manuscripts to the International","title-short":"Another Marx","type":"book"},{"id":"musto2019marx","abstract":"Faced with a new crisis of capitalism, many scholars are now looking back to the author whose ideas were too hastily dismissed after the fall of the Berlin Wall. During the last decade, Marx’s Capital has received renewed academic and popular attention. It has been reprinted in new editions throughout the world and the contemporary relevance of its pages is being discussed again. Today, Marx’s analyses are arguably resonating even more strongly than they did in his own time and Capital continues to provide an effective framework to understand the nature of capitalism and its transformations.   This volume includes the proceedings of the biggest international conference held in the world to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Capital’s publication. The book is divided into three parts: I) \"Capitalism, Past and Present\"; II) \"Extending the Critique of Capital\"; III) \"The Politics of Capital\". It contains the contributions of globally renowned scholars from 13 countries and multiple academic disciplines who offer diverse perspectives, and critical insights into the principal contradictions of contemporary capitalism while pointing to alternative economic and social models. Together, they reconsider the most influential historical debates on Capital and provide new interpretations of Marx’s magnum opus in light of themes rarely associated with Capital, such as gender, ecology, and non-European societies.   The book is an indispensable source for academic communities who are increasingly interested in rediscovering Marx beyond 20th century Marxism. Moreover, it will be of great appeal to students, as well as established scholars interested in critique of capitalism and socialist theory.","author":[{"family":"Musto","given":"Marcello"}],"citation-key":"musto2019marx","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-00-070694-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,23]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"313","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"London","source":"Google Books","title":"Marx's Capital after 150 Years: Critique and Alternative to Capitalism","title-short":"Marx's Capital after 150 Years","type":"book"},{"id":"musto2020last","abstract":"An innovative reassessment of the last writings and final years of Karl Marx. In the last years of his life, Karl Marx expanded his research in new directions—studying recent anthropological discoveries, analyzing communal forms of ownership in precapitalist societies, supporting the populist movement in Russia, and expressing critiques of colonial oppression in India, Ireland, Algeria, and Egypt. Between 1881 and 1883, he also traveled beyond Europe for the first and only time. Focusing on these last years of Marx's life, this book dispels two key misrepresentations of his work: that Marx ceased to write late in life, and that he was a Eurocentric and economic thinker fixated on class conflict alone. With The Last Years of Karl Marx, Marcello Musto claims a renewed relevance for the late work of Marx, highlighting unpublished or previously neglected writings, many of which remain unavailable in English. Readers are invited to reconsider Marx's critique of European colonialism, his ideas on non-Western societies, and his theories on the possibility of revolution in noncapitalist countries. From Marx's late manuscripts, notebooks, and letters emerge an author markedly different from the one represented by many of his contemporary critics and followers alike. As Marx currently experiences a significant rediscovery, this volume fills a gap in the popularly accepted biography and suggests an innovative reassessment of some of his key concepts.","author":[{"family":"Musto","given":"Marcello"}],"citation-key":"musto2020last","event-place":"Stanford","ISBN":"978-1-5036-1253-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,7]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"252","publisher":"Stanford University Press","publisher-place":"Stanford","source":"Google Books","title":"The Last Years of Karl Marx: An Intellectual Biography","title-short":"The Last Years of Karl Marx","type":"book"},{"id":"musto2020marx","abstract":"The planet is in deep trouble because of capitalism, and Karl Marx, freed from the chains of \"real socialism\", is being rediscovered all around the world as the thinker who provided us with its most insightful critique.

Many are again looking to an author who in the past was often wrongly associated with the Soviet Union, and who was too hastily dismissed after 1989. New or republished editions of Marx's work have become available almost everywhere. The literature dealing with Marx, which all but dried up twenty-five years ago, is showing signs of revival in many countries, and there are now many international conferences and university courses dedicated to his most significant work published in 1867. This Handbook provides an extensive survey of the dissemination and reception of Marx¿s Capital throughout the world, providing a more exhaustive account of the formation of Marxism than has previously been offered. The editors have assembled a cast of international experts of Marx's Capital. They explore, and critically reconsider, the history of the dissemination of Marx¿s Capital in all the languages (more than 70) in which the book was entirely translated. All the chapters are written by national authors and each chapter provides a short history of the penetration of Marxism in that country; tells the story of the different translations of Capital; explores the reception of Capital from both a political and a theoretical perspective; highlight the most influential interpretations of Capital and how they influenced the overall interpretation of Marx; and evaluates the importance of Capital in terms of the overall understanding of Marxism and, more broadly, Socialism. At a time when Marx¿s ideas - liberated from the chains of Soviet ideology - are being hailed for their prescience, an exhaustive account of the dissemination of his magnum opus will have significant implications not only for the understanding of the genesis of Marxism, but also the re-founding of a critical thought intended to transform the present.","author":[{"family":"Musto","given":"Marcello"},{"family":"Amini","given":"Babak"}],"citation-key":"musto2023routledge","ISBN":"978-1-138-10647-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,31]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"512","publisher":"Taylor & Francis Group","source":"Google Books","title":"Routledge Handbook of Marx's Capital","type":"book"},{"id":"naidu2010evolutionary","abstract":"We study equilibrium selection in stochastic evolutionary bargaining games in which idiosyncratic play is intentional instead of random.

The introductory chapter provides a comparatively informed framework for analyzing the interplay of markets and politics in the United States, focusing on three key factors: uniquely fragmented and decentralized political institutions; an interest group landscape characterized by weak labor organizations and powerful, parochial business groups; and an entrenched legacy of ethno-racial divisions embedded in both government and markets. Subsequent chapters look at the fundamental dynamics that result, including the place of the courts in multi-venue politics, the political economy of labor, sectional conflict within and across cities and regions, the consolidation of financial markets and corporate monopoly and monopsony power, and the ongoing rise of the knowledge economy. Together, the chapters provide a revealing new map of the politics of democratic capitalism in the United States.","author":[{"family":"Naidu","given":"Suresh"}],"citation-key":"naidu2021labor","container-title":"The American Political Economy: Politics, Markets, and Power","ISBN":"978-1-316-51636-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,11]]},"language":"en","page":"295-320","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Labor Market Power in the American Political Economy","type":"chapter"},{"id":"naidu2022if","abstract":"Abstract: One common metric of monopsony power is the quit elasticity, measuring how much more likely a worker is to quit a job in response to a wage change. Experimental and quasi-experimental variation in wages across workers within a given job results in quit elasticities in the 2-3 range, implying that a 10% reduction in wages increases the probability of quitting by 20-30%. In a model with monopsonistic employers, a quit elasticity of 2-3 also implies that workers are paid about 80-85% of the value they produce. These results indicate that employer power is pervasive. We present observational evidence that historically disadvantaged groups have systematically lower quit elasticities, indicating they face even greater employer power. Because monopsony power comes from an inability of workers to voluntarily switch jobs, the quit rate and especially the quit elasticity can be a useful metric for judging the health of the labor market. Pervasive employer power alters the analysis of labor market policy in a number of important ways.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Naidu","given":"Suresh"},{"family":"Carr","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"naidu2022if","container-title":"Journal of Law and Political Economy","DOI":"10.5070/LP63159035","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","source":"escholarship.org","title":"If You Don’t Like Your Job, Can You Always Quit?

By taking expectations with respect to preferences, actions, and procedures, one obtains meaningful measures of ex ante power.

I argue that clerics strategically adopt or reject Jihadi ideology because of career incentives generated by the structure of cleric educational networks.  Well-connected clerics enjoy substantial success at pursuing comfortable careers within state-run religious institutions and they reject Jihadi ideology in exchange for continued material support from the state. Clerics with poor educational networks cannot rely on connections to advance through the state-run institutions, so many pursue careers outside of the system by appealing directly to lay audiences for support.  These clerics are more likely to adopt Jihadi ideology because it helps them demonstrate to potential supporters that they have not been theologically coopted by political elites.  I provide evidence of these dynamics by collecting and analyzing 27,142 fatwas, articles, and books written by 101 contemporary clerics.  Using statistical natural language processing, I measure the extent to which each cleric adopts Jihadi ideology in their writing.  I combine this with biographical and network information about each cleric to trace the process by which poorly-connected clerics become more likely to adopt Jihadi ideology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Richard Alexander"}],"citation-key":"nielsen2013lonely","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,30]]},"language":"en_US","license":"open","source":"dash.harvard.edu","title":"The Lonely Jihadist: Weak Networks and the Radicalization of Muslim Clerics","title-short":"The Lonely Jihadist","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/11124850"},{"id":"nielson1998how","abstract":"Previous estimates of William Tyndale's contribution to the 1611 King James Version (or Authorized Version) of the Bible have run from a high of up to 90 per cent (Westcott) to a low of 18 per cent (Butterworth).

A close reading of Marx and Engels on the Russian question as well as Lenin up to and including What Is to Be Done disputes this argument, a variant on a long-held assumption, and the more general claim about the supposed distance between their projects. Marx and Engels accurately anticipated the Russian Revolution and provided the young Lenin with the necessary tools for applying their program to its reality. Rather than Kautsky and the German party, it was their perspective and program that he drew upon to understand and respond to developments, not only in Russia but in Germany as well.

Whereas hard power—the ability to coerce—grows out of a country's military or economic might, soft power arises from the attractiveness of a country's culture, political ideals, and policies. Hard power remains crucial in a world of states trying to guard their independence and of non-state groups willing to turn to violence. It forms the core of the Bush administration's new national security strategy. But according to Nye, the neo-conservatives who advise the president are making a major miscalculation: They focus too heavily on using America's military power to force other nations to do our will, and they pay too little heed to our soft power. It is soft power that will help prevent terrorists from recruiting supporters from among the moderate majority. And it is soft power that will help us deal with critical global issues that require multilateral cooperation among states. That is why it is so essential that America better understands and applies our soft power.

We live in the age of the algorithm. Increasingly, the decisions that affect our lives--where we go to school, whether we get a car loan, how much we pay for health insurance--are being made not by humans, but by mathematical models. In theory, this should lead to greater fairness: Everyone is judged according to the same rules, and bias is eliminated.  But as Cathy O'Neil reveals in this urgent and necessary book, the opposite is true. The models being used today are opaque, unregulated, and uncontestable, even when they're wrong. Most troubling, they reinforce discrimination: If a poor student can't get a loan because a lending model deems him too risky (by virtue of his zip code), he's then cut off from the kind of education that could pull him out of poverty, and a vicious spiral ensues. Models are propping up the lucky and punishing the downtrodden, creating a \"toxic cocktail for democracy.\" Welcome to the dark side of Big Data.  Tracing the arc of a person's life, O'Neil exposes the black box models that shape our future, both as individuals and as a society. These \"weapons of math destruction\" score teachers and students, sort résumés, grant (or deny) loans, evaluate workers, target voters, set parole, and monitor our health.  O'Neil calls on modelers to take more responsibility for their algorithms and on policy makers to regulate their use. But in the end, it's up to us to become more savvy about the models that govern our lives.

By nature, the language of law is strict, hence the predominant use of modal logic as a substitute for the syntactical ambiguity in natural language, specifically, deontic and alethic logic for the respective modalities. However, deontic modalities which express obligations, prohibitions and permissions, can have varying degree and preciseness to which they correspond to a matter, strict deontic logic does not allow for such quantitative measures. Therefore, this paper outlines a data-driven approach by classifying deontic modalities using ensembled Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) that incorporate domain specific legal distributional semantic model (DSM) representations, in combination with, a general DSM representation. We propose to use well calibrated probability estimates from these classifiers as an approximation to the degree which an obligation/prohibition or permission belongs to a given class based on SME annotated sentences. Best results show 82.33 % accuracy on a held-out test set.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"O'Neill","given":"James"},{"family":"Buitelaar","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Robin","given":"Cecile"},{"family":"O'Brien","given":"Leona"}],"citation-key":"oneill2017classifying","collection-title":"ICAIL '17","container-title":"Proceedings of the 16th Edition of the International Conference on Articial Intelligence and Law","DOI":"10.1145/3086512.3086528","event-place":"London, United Kingdom","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4891-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"159–168","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Classifying Sentential Modality in Legal Language: A Use Case in Financial Regulations, Acts and Directives","title-short":"Classifying Sentential Modality in Legal Language","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3086512.3086528"},{"id":"ore_pascal_1960","author":[{"family":"Ore","given":"O."}],"citation-key":"ore_pascal_1960","container-title":"American Mathematical Monthly","issued":{"date-parts":[["1960"]]},"language":"en","page":"409-419","title":"Pascal and the invention of probability theory","type":"article-journal","volume":"67"},{"id":"orizio2001lost","abstract":"Over 300 hundred years ago, the first European colonists landed in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean to found permanent outposts of the great empires. This epic migration continued until after World War II, when some of these tropical colonies became independent black nations and the white colonials were forced -- or chose -- to return to the mother country. Among the descendants of the colonizing powers, however, were some who had become outcasts in the poorest strata of society and, unable to afford the long journey home, were left behind, ignored by both the former oppressed indigenous population and the modern privileged white immigrants.  At the dawn of the twenty-first century these lost white tribes still hold out, tucked away in remote valleys and hills or in the midst of burgeoning metropolises, living in poverty while tending the myths of their colonial ancestors. Forced to marry within their own group if they hope to retain their fair-skinned \"purity,\" they are torn between the memory of past privilege and the extraordinary pressure to integrate. All are decreasing in number; some are on the verge of extinction and fighting to survive in countries that ostracize them because of the color of their skin and the traditions they represent. Though resident for generations, these people are permanently out of place, an awkward and embarrassing reminder of things past in newly redefined countries that are eager to forget both them and their historical homelands.  In the remote interior and in bustling Sao Paulo, the \"Confederados\" of Brazil linger on, the descendants of Confederate families that fled the American South to rebuild their society here rather than face victoriousYankees. Wrenchingly poor then and now, these would-be genteel planters cling to their romanticized memory of a proud antebellum past. In Sri Lanka, once Ceylon, the children of Dutch Burghers haunt their crumbling mansions, putting on airs and keeping up appearances. In the steaming jungle of Guadeloupe, the inbred and deformed Matignons Blancs scrape out an existence while claiming the blood of French kings in their veins. On the beaches of Jamaica, a young man with incongruously blond dreadlocks -- the destitute descendant of a shoemaker from the Duchy of Saxony who became an indentured servant to earn passage from Germany to the new world -- still gazes out at the Caribbean over a century and half later. The Poles of Haiti are descended from troops lured over by Napoleon to quell slave rebellions. His promise of independence for their homeland went unfulfilled; they persist in hidden valleys in the island's interior. In the desert expanses of Southwest Africa, the famously devout Basters, the green-eyed, mixed-race Afrikaners, still doggedly pursue vast territorial claims as the continent's new power brokers sweep them aside. These are the lost white tribes.  More than an entree into a world we are unfamiliar with, this amazing chronicle opens up a world that we did not even know existed. In his masterful report, Riccardo Orizio has written the final chapter in the history of the postcolonial world, and in him these forgotten peoples have found their unique historian.","author":[{"family":"Orizio","given":"Riccardo"}],"citation-key":"orizio2001lost","ISBN":"978-0-7432-1197-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"306","publisher":"Simon and Schuster","source":"Google Books","title":"Lost White Tribes: The End of Privilege and the Last Colonials in Sri Lanka, Jamaica, Brazil, Haiti, Namibia, and Guadeloupe","title-short":"Lost White Tribes","type":"book"},{"id":"osborne1994course","abstract":"A Course in Game Theory presents the main ideas of game theory at a level suitable for graduate students and advanced undergraduates, emphasizing the theory's foundations and interpretations of its basic concepts.

While civic republicanism is often attacked for its conservatism, the relatively neglected radical history of the tradition shows how a republican form of socialism provides powerful conceptual resources to critique capitalism for leaving workers and citizens dominated. This analysis supports a programme of public ownership and economic democracy intended to reduce domination in the workplace and wider society. I defend this socialist republicanism from both the Marxist objection that it overlooks the impersonal nature of domination under capitalism and the left-liberal objections that property-owning democracy or worker codetermination are sufficient to suppress dominating relationships. The resulting position identifies the need for more ambitious institutional grounds for republican liberty than is often supposed, while offering us a distinctive emancipatory justification for socialism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"O’Shea","given":"Tom"}],"citation-key":"oshea2020socialist","container-title":"Political Theory","DOI":"10.1177/0090591719876889","ISSN":"0090-5917","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"548-572","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Socialist Republicanism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0090591719876889","volume":"48"},{"id":"otter2020unified","abstract":"A key concern in network analysis is the study of social positions and roles of actors in a network.

An open question in network science is whether it is possible to simultaneously perform role and positional analysis.

NEW STATESMAN Between 1947 and 1949, over 400 Palestinian villages were deliberately destroyed, civilians were massacred and around a million men, women, and children were expelled from their homes at gunpoint. Denied for almost six decades, had it happened today it could only have been called 'ethnic cleansing'.

The cornerstone of this racially stratified legal system was the Population Registration Act of 1950, which required that all South Africans needed to be registered and assigned to an official racial category. We study the effect of racial classification in the context of these legislative reforms, by estimating the causal effect of being classified as White, relative to being classified as Coloured, on labour market outcomes. For identification we exploit a policy change that privileged ancestry over appearance in the process of racial classification for those born after 1951. Using census data from 1980, 1991, and 1996, we find a discontinuity in racial shares for cohorts born after 1951. Our preferred estimates indicate that being classified as White resulted in a more than fourfold increase in income for men.

From economic development to health care to education and public policy, we rely on numbers to allocate resources and make crucial decisions. But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this insidious bias: in time, in money, and often with their lives.  Celebrated feminist advocate Caroline Criado Perez investigates this shocking root cause of gender inequality in Invisible Women. Examining the home, the workplace, the public square, the doctor’s office, and more, Criado Perez unearths a dangerous pattern in data and its consequences on women’s lives. Product designers use a “one-size-fits-all” approach to everything from pianos to cell phones to voice recognition software, when in fact this approach is designed to fit men. Cities prioritize men’s needs when designing public transportation, roads, and even snow removal, neglecting to consider women’s safety or unique responsibilities and travel patterns. And in medical research, women have largely been excluded from studies and textbooks, leaving them chronically misunderstood, mistreated, and misdiagnosed.

But how does the market appear from the perspective of a rival conception of freedom (freedom as non-domination) that is linked with the Roman and neo-Roman tradition of republicanism? The republican conception of freedom argues for important normative constraints on property, exchange, and regulation, without supporting extremes to the effect that ?property is theft? or ?taxation is theft? or anything of that kind. It does not cast a cold eye on commerce; it merely provides an alternative view of the attractions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Pettit","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"pettit2006freedom","container-title":"Politics, Philosophy & Economics","DOI":"10.1177/1470594X06064218","ISSN":"1470-594X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"131-149","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Freedom in the market","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1470594X06064218","volume":"5"},{"id":"pettit2008dahl","abstract":"Dahl's classic analysis of power needs a few more or less minor corrections and it needs to be extended so that power can be exercised other than by punctual actions and can have other than punctual effects.

Philip Pettit addresses this crucial question in On the People's Terms. He argues that state coercion will not involve individual subjection or domination insofar as we enjoy an equally shared form of control over those in power.

Whereas many thinkers define freedom as the absence of interference—we are left alone to do as we please—Pettit demands that in their basic life choices free persons should not even be subject to a power of interference on the part of others. This notion of freedom as non-domination offers a yardstick for gauging social and democratic progress and provides a simple, unifying standard for analyzing our most entangled political quandaries. Pettit reaffirms the ideal, already present in the Roman Republic, of a free citizenry who enjoy equal status with one another, being individually protected by a law that they together control. After sketching a fresh history of freedom, he turns to the implications of the ideal for social, democratic, and international justice. Should the state erect systems for delivering mandatory healthcare coverage to its citizens? Should voting be a citizen’s only means of influencing political leaders? Are the demands of the United Nations to be heeded when they betray the sovereignty of the state? Pettit shows how these and other questions should be resolved within a civic republican perspective. Concise and elegant in its rhetoric and ultimately radical in its reimagining of our social arrangements, Just Freedom is neither a theoretical treatise nor a practical manifesto, but rather an ardent attempt to elaborate the demands of freedom and justice in our time.","author":[{"family":"Pettit","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"pettit2014just","ISBN":"978-0-393-06397-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,10]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"288","publisher":"W.

In this remarkable treatise, Polanyi attests that our personal experiences and ways of sharing knowledge have a profound effect on scientific discovery. He argues against the idea of the wholly dispassionate researcher, pointing out that even in the strictest of sciences, knowing is still an art, and that personal commitment and passion are logically necessary parts of research. In our technological age where fact is split from value and science from humanity, Polanyi’s work continues to advocate for the innate curiosity and scientific leaps of faith that drive our most dazzling ingenuity.  For this expanded edition, Polyani scholar Mary Jo Nye set the philosopher-scientist’s work into contemporary context, offering fresh insights and providing a helpful guide to critical terms in the work.

Today, while the U.S. enjoys tremendous military and economic power, citizens are increasingly insulated from everyday decision-making. This was not always the case. America, Aziz Rana argues, began as a settler society grounded in an ideal of freedom as the exercise of continuous self-rule—one that joined direct political participation with economic independence. However, this vision of freedom was politically bound to the subordination of marginalized groups, especially slaves, Native Americans, and women. These practices of liberty and exclusion were not separate currents, but rather two sides of the same coin. However, at crucial moments, social movements sought to imagine freedom without either subordination or empire. By the mid-twentieth century, these efforts failed, resulting in the rise of hierarchical state and corporate institutions. This new framework presented national and economic security as society’s guiding commitments and nurtured a continual extension of America’s global reach. Rana envisions a democratic society that revives settler ideals, but combines them with meaningful inclusion for those currently at the margins of American life.","author":[{"family":"Rana","given":"Aziz"}],"citation-key":"rana2014two","ISBN":"978-0-674-05896-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,7]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"428","publisher":"Harvard University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Two Faces of American Freedom","type":"book"},{"id":"rao_linear_1973","author":[{"family":"Rao","given":"C.R."}],"citation-key":"rao_linear_1973","edition":"2nd","event-place":"New York","issued":{"date-parts":[["1973"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons","publisher-place":"New York","title":"Linear statistical inference and its applications","type":"book"},{"id":"rauhala2017dissemination","abstract":"I contrast the dissemination and reception of Capital in Finland with its dissemination in other Scandinavian countries.

Previous work has proposed techniques to make machine learning more fair through awareness of the protected attributes of user data. However, these studies have either focused on specific tasks, been primarily theoretical, or have ignored the highly important domain of location-based advertising. In this work, we present an empirical analysis of the impact of fairness on advertising revenue using a real world example: location based ad personalization for users of Instagram. We empirically analyze the potential for inadvertent discrimination among gender and race in location-based systems, additionally showing the impact of location representation on fairness. Furthermore, we apply fairness techniques to analyze how revenue is affected when both individual and group fairness guarantees must hold.

Understood in this light, Capital emerges as a profound work of political theory. Placing Marx against the background of nineteenth-century socialism, Roberts shows how Capital was ingeniously modeled on Dante’s Inferno, and how Marx, playing the role of Virgil for the proletariat, introduced partisans of workers’ emancipation to the secret depths of the modern “social Hell.” In this manner, Marx revised republican ideas of freedom in response to the rise of capitalism.Combining research on Marx’s interlocutors, textual scholarship, and forays into recent debates, Roberts traces the continuities linking Marx’s theory of capitalism to the tradition of republican political thought. He immerses the reader in socialist debates about the nature of commerce, the experience of labor, the power of bosses and managers, and the possibilities of political organization. Roberts rescues those debates from the past, and shows how they speak to ever-renewed concerns about political life in today’s world.","author":[{"family":"Roberts","given":"William Clare"}],"citation-key":"roberts2016marx","event-place":"Princeton","ISBN":"978-1-4008-8370-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"299","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton","source":"Google Books","title":"Marx's Inferno: The Political Theory of Capital","title-short":"Marx's Inferno","type":"book"},{"id":"roberts2016model","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Roberts","given":"Margaret E."},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Brandon M."},{"family":"Airoldi","given":"Edoardo M."}],"citation-key":"roberts2016model","container-title":"Journal of the American Statistical Association","container-title-short":"Journal of the American Statistical Association","DOI":"10.1080/01621459.2016.1141684","ISSN":"0162-1459","issue":"515","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",7,2]]},"page":"988-1003","source":"tandfonline.com (Atypon)","title":"A Model of Text for Experimentation in the Social Sciences","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/01621459.2016.1141684","volume":"111"},{"id":"roberts2020what","abstract":"The ongoing critical redeployment of primitive accumulation proceeds under two premises. First, it is argued that Marx, erroneously, confined primitive accumulation to the earliest history of capitalism. Second, Marx is supposed to have teleologically justified primitive accumulation as a necessary precondition for socialist development. This article argues that reading Marx?s account of primitive accumulation in the context of contemporaneous debates about working class and socialist strategy rebuts both of these criticisms. Marx?s definition of primitive accumulation as the ?prehistory of capital? does not deny its contemporaneity, but marks the distinction between the operations of capital and those of other agencies ? especially the state ? which are necessary, but also external, to capital itself. This same distinction between capital, which accumulates via the exploitation of labour-power, and the state, which becomes dependent upon capitalist accumulation for its own existence, recasts the historical necessity of primitive accumulation. Marx characterizes the modern state as the armed and servile agent of capital, willing to carry out primitive accumulation wherever the conditions of capitalist accumulation are threatened. Hence, the recent reconstructions risk obliterating Marx?s key insights into the specificity of a) capital as a form of wealth and b) capital?s relationship to the state.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Roberts","given":"William Clare"}],"citation-key":"roberts2020what","container-title":"European Journal of Political Theory","DOI":"10.1177/1474885117735961","ISSN":"1474-8851","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"532-552","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"What was primitive accumulation?

He unites the economist's skill in constructing precise, axiomatic models with the philosopher's in exploring the assumptions of those models. His synthesis will enable philosophers and economists to engage each other's ideas more fruitfully.Roemer first shows how economists' understanding of the fairness of various resource allocation mechanisms can be enriched. He extends the economic theory of social choice to show how individual preferences can be aggregated into social preferences over various alternatives. He critiques the standard applications of axiomatic bargaining theory to distributive justice, showing that they ignore information on available resources and preference orderings. He puts these variables in the models, which enable him to generate resource allocation mechanisms that are more consonant with our intuitions about distributive justice. He then critiques economists' theories of utilitarianism and examines the question of the optimal population size in a world of finite resources.Roemer explores the major new philosophical concepts of the theory of distributive justice--primary goods, functionings and capability, responsibility in its various forms, procedural versus outcome justice, midfare--and shows how they can be sharpened and clarified with the aid of economic analysis. He critiques and extends the ideas of major contemporary theories of distributive justice, including those of Rawls, Sen, Nozick, and Dworkin. Beginning from the recent theories of Arneson and G. A. Cohen, he constructs a theory of equality of opportunity. Theories of Distributive Justice contains important and original results, and it can also be used as a graduate-level text in economics and philosophy.","author":[{"family":"Roemer","given":"John E."}],"citation-key":"roemer1996theories","ISBN":"978-0-674-87920-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"358","publisher":"Harvard University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Theories of Distributive Justice","type":"book"},{"id":"roemer1998equality","abstract":"John Roemer points out that there are two views of equality of opportunity that are widely held today. The first, which he calls the nondiscrimination principle, states that in the competition for positions in society, individuals should be judged only on attributes relevant to the performance of the duties of the position in question. Attributes such as race or sex should not be taken into account. The second states that society should do what it can to level the playing field among persons who compete for positions, especially during their formative years, so that all those who have the relevant potential attributes can be considered.Common to both positions is that at some point the principle of equal opportunity holds individuals accountable for achievements of particular objectives, whether they be education, employment, health, or income. Roemer argues that there is consequently a \"before\" and an \"after\" in the notion of equality of opportunity: before the competition starts, opportunities must be equalized, by social intervention if need be; but after it begins, individuals are on their own. The different views of equal opportunity should be judged according to where they place the starting gate which separates \"before\" from \"after.\" Roemer works out in a precise way how to determine the location of the starting gate in the different views.","author":[{"family":"Roemer","given":"John E."}],"citation-key":"roemer1998equality","ISBN":"978-0-674-04287-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"130","publisher":"Harvard University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Equality of Opportunity","type":"book"},{"id":"roemer2016equality","abstract":"During the last third of the twentieth century, political philosophers actively debated about the content of distributive justice; the ruling ethical view of utilitarianism was challenged by various versions of equality of opportunities.

After presenting a review of the main philosophical ideas (section 2), we turn to economic models (sections 3 and 4). We propose a reformulation of the definition of economic development, replacing the utilitarian measure of GDP per capita with a measure of the degree to which opportunities for income acquisition in a nation have been equalized.

Rogers, professor and chair of the Department of Communication & Journalism at the University of New Mexico, explains how new ideas spread via communication channels over time. Such innovations are initially perceived as uncertain and even risky. To overcome this uncertainty, most people seek out others like themselves who have already adopted the new idea. Thus the diffusion process consists of a few individuals who first adopt an innovation, then spread the word among their circle of acquaintances—a process which typically takes months or years.

Furthermore, the Internet is changing the very nature of diffusion by decreasing the importance of physical distance between people.

This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables—colliders and mediators—should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Rohrer","given":"Julia M."}],"citation-key":"rohrer2018thinking","container-title":"Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science","DOI":"10.1177/2515245917745629","ISSN":"2515-2459","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"27-42","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Thinking Clearly About Correlations and Causation: Graphical Causal Models for Observational Data","title-short":"Thinking Clearly About Correlations and Causation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245917745629","volume":"1"},{"id":"rojahn1983marxismus","abstract":"Über den Beitrag des Marxismus zur Erforschung der Geschichte ist bereits so viel geschrieben, daß die Literatur zu diesem Thema kaurn noch überschaubar ist; auf den Beitrag der Geschichtswissenschaft zur Erforschung des Marxismus, d.h. primär der Ansichten von Marx, wird kaum je eingegangen — was nicht so erstaunlich scheint.

Hegel's \"dialectical method\" is not a method of logical argumentation, but a \"method\" of paralogical mystification. Marx's own attempts to construct \"dialectical derivations\" of economic categories in the \"Grundrisse\" lead him into theoretical culs-desac, and he is only able to make real progress in his economic investigations by precisely foregoing such adventures. The persistence, nonetheless, of certain characteristically Hegelian formulae—though, n. b., not characteristically Hegelian argumentational structures—in \"Capital\", and especially in the first chapter, is a function of the ontological peculiarity of Marx's initial object of inquiry, viz., money, and does not reflect any \"methodological\" choice.

Foreigners and northerners were less inclined to enforce the system of slavery, more willing to flout the law, more likely to view slaves as unwelcome competitors for jobs, and less able financially to hire or purchase slaves. Census data for five Deep South towns in 1860 show that white northerners and foreigners invested less in slavery than native-born southerners did--even after wealth differences among the groups are factored out. Migrants to the South who used slaves were less likely than native southerners to persist in doing so. The diaries, letters, and memoirs of native and adoptive southerners indicate that those born and reared outside the South were more likely to harbor antislavery feelings. Thus, the large \"outsider\" presence in the Old South made southerners highly conflicted about the ethnocultural diversity of the region and especially suspicious of its urban places.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Rousey","given":"Dennis C."}],"citation-key":"rousey2001friends","container-title":"Journal of Social History","ISSN":"0022-4529","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"page":"373-396","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"Friends and Foes of Slavery: Foreigners and Northerners in the Old South","title-short":"Friends and Foes of Slavery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3790193","volume":"35"},{"id":"rousseau1762social","author":[{"family":"Rousseau","given":"Jean-Jacques"}],"citation-key":"rousseau1762social","event-place":"Geneva","issued":{"date-parts":[["1762"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"344","publisher":"J.

The EMD is based on the minimal cost that must be paid to transform one distribution into the other, in a precise sense, and was first proposed for certain vision problems by Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For image retrieval, we combine this idea with a representation scheme for distributions that is based on vector quantization. This combination leads to an image comparison framework that often accounts for perceptual similarity better than other previously proposed methods. The EMD is based on a solution to the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available, and also allows naturally for partial matching. It is more robust than histogram matching techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length representations of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems typical of histograms. When used to compare distributions with the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric. In this paper we focus on applications to color and texture, and we compare the retrieval performance of the EMD with that of other distances.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Rubner","given":"Yossi"},{"family":"Tomasi","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Guibas","given":"Leonidas J."}],"citation-key":"rubner2000earth","container-title":"International Journal of Computer Vision","container-title-short":"International Journal of Computer Vision","DOI":"10.1023/A:1026543900054","ISSN":"1573-1405","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"99-121","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Earth Mover's Distance as a Metric for Image Retrieval","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1026543900054","volume":"40"},{"id":"rude1959crowd","author":[{"family":"Rudé","given":"George"}],"citation-key":"rude1959crowd","issued":{"date-parts":[["1959"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"268","publisher":"Oxford U.P.

Weights directly capture society's concerns for fairness without being necessarily tied to individual utilities. Suitable weights can help reconcile discrepancies between the welfarist approach and actual tax practice, as well as unify in an operational way the most prominent alternatives to utilitarianism such as Libertarianism, equality of opportunity, or poverty alleviation.

Understandably, this perspective has come under sharp attack, not only from mainstream environmentalists but also from ecosocialists, many of whom reject Marx outright. Kohei Saito’s Karl Marx’s Ecosocialism lays waste to accusations of Marx’s ecological shortcomings. Delving into Karl Marx’s central works, as well as his natural scientific notebooks—published only recently and still being translated—Saito also builds on the works of scholars such as John Bellamy Foster and Paul Burkett, to argue that Karl Marx actually saw the environmental crisis embedded in capitalism. “It is not possible to comprehend the full scope of [Marx’s] critique of political economy,” Saito writes, “if one ignores its ecological dimension.” Saito’s book is crucial today, as we face unprecedented ecological catastrophes—crises that cannot be adequately addressed without a sound theoretical framework. Karl Marx’s Ecosocialism shows us that Marx has given us more than we once thought, that we can now come closer to finishing Marx’s critique, and to building a sustainable ecosocialist world.","author":[{"family":"Saito","given":"Kohei"}],"citation-key":"saito2017karl","ISBN":"978-1-58367-640-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,24]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"308","publisher":"NYU Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Karl Marx’s Ecosocialism: Capital, Nature, and the Unfinished Critique of Political Economy","title-short":"Karl Marx’s Ecosocialism","type":"book"},{"id":"sanyal2014rethinking","abstract":"In this book, Kalyan Sanyal reviews the traditional notion of capitalism and propounds an original theory of capitalist development in the post-colonial context.

It also furnishes a catalogue of nearly fifteen hundred entries of his reading, compiled from references and allusions in his published writings, journal, correspondence, library charging records, the catalogue of his personal library, and his many unpublished notebooks and commonplace books. This record suggests his literary and intellectual development as a youth primarily interested in classical and early English literature, who matured as a writer investigating contemporary and classical natural science, the history of the European discovery and exploration of North America, and the history of native Americans.The catalogue provides bibliographical data for, and lists all Thoreau's references to, the books and articles that he read. The introductory essay traces the shifts in his literary career marked in the chronology of his reading. The book reveals a Thoreau who was deeply interested in and conversant with the major intellectual questions of his times and whose stance of withdrawal from his age masked a lively involvement with many of its most perplexing questions.Originally published in 1988.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

The United States has trained tens of thousands of officers in foreign militaries with the goals of increasing its security and instilling respect for human rights, democracy, and civilian control. We argue that training increases the military's power relative to the regime in a way that other forms of military assistance do not. While other forms of military assistance are somewhat fungible, allowing the regime to shift resources towards coup-proofing, human capital is a resource vested solely in the military. Training thus alters the balance of power between the military and the regime resulting in greater coup propensity.

This collection of twenty essays stems from a 1997 conference that celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Institute for Advanced Study's School of Social Science. The authors, who represent a wide range of disciplines, are all associated with the School's emphasis on interpretive social science, which rejects models from the hard sciences and opts instead for a humanistic approach to social inquiry. Following a preface by Clifford Geertz, whose profound insights have helped shape the School from the outset, the essays are arranged in four sections. The first offers personal reflections on disciplinary changes; the second features essays advocating changes in focus or methodology; the third presents field overviews and institutional history; while the fourth addresses the link between political philosophy and world governance. Two recurring themes are the uses (and pitfalls) of interdisciplinary studies and the relation between scholarship and social change. This book will be rewarding for anyone interested in how changing trends in scholarship shape the understanding of our social worlds.

With the increasing enthusiasm in autonomous solutions for vehicular and robotics navigation, much of the maneuverability can be provided based on solutions that can track multiple targets, in a computationally inexpensive and accurate manner. This thesis is concerned with solving the problem of tracking multiple point targets, which is a common occurrence in many tracking applications. The main challenge in multi-target tracking is to resolve measurement-to-target association uncertainties, also called the data association uncertainties. Using the Bayesian approach, these uncertainties are modeled as random variables; where, each instance of the data association variable corresponds to a unique data association hypothesis. The objective, then, is to use the measurements from sensors to choose the best data association hypothesis, from which the estimates of target trajectories can be obtained. In an ideal world, we could maintain all possible data association hypotheses from observing all measurements, and pick the best hypothesis. But, it turns out the number of data association hypotheses grows exponentially with the number of measurements over time, rendering this optimal solution intractable. Vast literature in the multi-target tracking is dedicated to solving this problem tractably. In this thesis, a variational Bayesian approach has been used, more specifically, the main contribution is to use expectation maximization (EM) in tracking multiple point targets. EM is an iterative algorithm that can be used to approximate the best data association hypotheses, and/or target state estimates in a computationally efficient manner. Depending on, if the overall joint density is maximized over the data association variables, or over the target state variables, two EM-based algorithms for tracking multiple point targets are derived, implemented and evaluated. In the first algorithm, the data association variable is integrated out, and the target states are estimated. In the second algorithm, the data association variable is estimated, while the target states are integrated out. In the end, both the algorithms yield the desired target states. It is shown that the two proposed algorithms can be implemented using existing, simpler solution blocks like Bayesian smoothing, 2-D auction algorithm and computation of marginal data association probabilities. Performance of the two proposed algorithms are compared with existing multi-target algorithms, to highlight the overall improvement in performance, and possible future extensions to the work are presented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Selvan","given":"Raghavendra"}],"citation-key":"selvan2015bayesian","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Bayesian tracking of multiple point targets using expectation maximization","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Bayesian-tracking-of-multiple-point-targets-using-Selvan/56b513b8bb93c1927b75b3ad415d6651e28cc646"},{"id":"sen1982utilitarianism","abstract":"A volume of studies of utilitarianism considered both as a theory of personal morality and a theory of public choice.

Start-Up Nation addresses the trillion dollar question: How is it that Israel -- a country of 7.1 million, only 60 years old, surrounded by enemies, in a constant state of war since its founding, with no natural resources-- produces more start-up companies than large, peaceful, and stable nations like Japan, China, India, Korea, Canada and the UK?

Distance metrics typically produce less accurate estimates than actual measurements, but each metric provides a single model of travel over a given network. Therefore, distance metrics, unlike actual measurements, can be directly used in spatial analytical modeling. Euclidean distance is most often used, but unlikely the most appropriate metric. Minkowski distance is a more promising method. Distances estimated with each metric are contrasted with road distance and travel time measurements, and an optimized Minkowski distance is implemented in spatial analytical modeling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Shahid","given":"Rizwan"},{"family":"Bertazzon","given":"Stefania"},{"family":"Knudtson","given":"Merril L."},{"family":"Ghali","given":"William A."}],"citation-key":"shahid2009comparison","container-title":"BMC Health Services Research","container-title-short":"BMC Health Services Research","DOI":"10.1186/1472-6963-9-200","ISSN":"1472-6963","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",11,6]]},"page":"200","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Comparison of distance measures in spatial analytical modeling for health service planning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-9-200","volume":"9"},{"id":"shanin1983late","abstract":"\"The mid-part of the book is mainly given to the drafts of Marx's 1881 discussion concerning rural Russia and some supplementary materials ...

The analysis is an outgrowth of a larger research project, \"Quantitative Studies of the French Revolution,\" conducted by the authors and others over a thirty-year period. The central data of the research for this book are a coding of a national sample of documents representing the views of rural parishes, the Nobility, and the Third Estate. These codes, together with data on the economic, social, and political conditions of the regions of France under the Old Regime and data on political behavior during the revolutionary period, form a computerized data archive to be made available to researchers. The book is in four parts. Part I describes content analysis as a method and its varieties, controversies, and problems. Part II discusses the cahiers and their authenticity and usefulness as a historical source. Part III considers the coding procedures, information about the sample, and studies bearing on the evaluation of the coding process. Part IV, the largest part of the book, presents some of the authors' findings to date, including a summary of the concerns expressed by the nation in 1789, a study of the attitudes toward the monarchy, an analysis of consensus and conflict among the Estates, and the influence of social mobility upon political radicalism.

The method is based on a technique of the mathematical theory of games, applied to what are known there as “simple games” and “weighted majority games.” We apply it here to a number of illustrative cases, including the United States Congress, and discuss some of its formal properties.The designing of the size and type of a legislative body is a process that may continue for many years, with frequent revisions and modifications aimed at reflecting changes in the social structure of the country; we may cite the role of the House of Lords in England as an example. The effect of a revision usually cannot be gauged in advance except in the roughest terms; it can easily happen that the mathematical structure of a voting system conceals a bias in power distribution unsuspected and unintended by the authors of the revision. How, for example, is one to predict the degree of protection which a proposed system affords to minority interests? Can a consistent criterion for “fair representation” be found? It is difficult even to describe the net effect of a double representation system such as is found in the U. S. Congress (i.e., by states and by population), without attempting to deduce it a priori. The method of measuring “power” which we present in this paper is intended as a first step in the attack on these problems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Shapley","given":"L.

It explores how Marx experienced an array of differentially developed yet related societies through a consciousness of backwardness, and how this consciousness moulded his praxis. In this respect, the article takes issue with the Marxist assumption that the silence in Capital regarding the multi-linear character of modern world development is ultimately non-harmful to the volumes' uni-linear notion of modern world development. The aim of the article is essentially to clear the way for a more rigorous Historical Materialist appreciation of multi-linearity in modern world development. It does so by arguing that the condition of multi-linearity in modern world development formed the very terrain upon which Marx intellectually journeyed towards Capital. Specifically, the framing of the Capital volumes around a singular dialectic of social transformation should be considered as the failed outcome of Marx's pre-existing engagement with the problem of multi-linearity. This argument has ramifications for contemporary Marxist understandings of world development, as well as demonstrating the general importance of contextualizing political thought through an international rather than national or universal historical narrative.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Shilliam","given":"Robbie"}],"citation-key":"shilliam_marxs_2006","container-title":"History of Political Thought","ISSN":"0143-781X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"349-375","publisher":"Imprint Academic Ltd.","source":"JSTOR","title":"Marx's Path to Capital: The International Dimension of an Intellectual Journey","title-short":"MARX'S PATH TO \"CAPITAL\"","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26222199","volume":"27"},{"id":"sidney1698discourses","author":[{"family":"Sidney","given":"Algernon"}],"citation-key":"sidney1698discourses","issued":{"date-parts":[["1698"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"774","publisher":"A.

He solidified his standing as the nation's foremost political forecaster with his near perfect prediction of the 2012 election. Silver is the founder and editor in chief of the website FiveThirtyEight.   Drawing on his own groundbreaking work, Silver examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data. Most predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the “prediction paradox”: The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future.In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, Silver visits the most successful forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball to global pandemics, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. He explains and evaluates how these forecasters think and what bonds they share. What lies behind their success? Are they good—or just lucky? What patterns have they unraveled? And are their forecasts really right? He explores unanticipated commonalities and exposes unexpected juxtapositions. And sometimes, it is not so much how good a prediction is in an absolute sense that matters but how good it is relative to the competition. In other cases, prediction is still a very rudimentary—and dangerous—science.Silver observes that the most accurate forecasters tend to have a superior command of probability, and they tend to be both humble and hardworking. They distinguish the predictable from the unpredictable, and they notice a thousand little details that lead them closer to the truth. Because of their appreciation of probability, they can distinguish the signal from the noise.With everything from the health of the global economy to our ability to fight terrorism dependent on the quality of our predictions, Nate Silver’s insights are an essential read.","author":[{"family":"Silver","given":"Nate"}],"citation-key":"silver2012signal","ISBN":"978-0-14-312508-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"562","publisher":"Penguin","source":"Google Books","title":"The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail--but Some Don't","title-short":"The Signal and the Noise","type":"book"},{"id":"simon1953notes","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Simon","given":"Herbert A."}],"citation-key":"simon1953notes","container-title":"The Journal of Politics","DOI":"10.2307/2126538","ISSN":"0022-3816","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1953",11]]},"page":"500-516","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Notes on the Observation and Measurement of Political Power","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.2307/2126538","volume":"15"},{"id":"simons2023algorithms","abstract":"How to put democracy at the heart of AI governanceArtificial intelligence and machine learning are reshaping our world. Police forces use them to decide where to send police officers, judges to decide whom to release on bail, welfare agencies to decide which children are at risk of abuse, and Facebook and Google to rank content and distribute ads. In these spheres, and many others, powerful prediction tools are changing how decisions are made, narrowing opportunities for the exercise of judgment, empathy, and creativity. In Algorithms for the People, Josh Simons flips the narrative about how we govern these technologies. Instead of examining the impact of technology on democracy, he explores how to put democracy at the heart of AI governance.Drawing on his experience as a research fellow at Harvard University, a visiting research scientist on Facebook’s Responsible AI team, and a policy advisor to the UK’s Labour Party, Simons gets under the hood of predictive technologies, offering an accessible account of how they work, why they matter, and how to regulate the institutions that build and use them.He argues that prediction is political: human choices about how to design and use predictive tools shape their effects. Approaching predictive technologies through the lens of political theory casts new light on how democracies should govern political choices made outside the sphere of representative politics. Showing the connection between technology regulation and democratic reform, Simons argues that we must go beyond conventional theorizing of AI ethics to wrestle with fundamental moral and political questions about how the governance of technology can support the flourishing of democracy.","author":[{"family":"Simons","given":"Josh"}],"citation-key":"simons2023algorithms","ISBN":"978-0-691-24400-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,10]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"320","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Algorithms for the People: Democracy in the Age of AI","title-short":"Algorithms for the People","type":"book"},{"id":"simpson_bayesian_1975","author":[{"family":"Simpson","given":"J."},{"family":"Olsen","given":"A."},{"family":"Eden","given":"J.C."}],"citation-key":"simpson_bayesian_1975","container-title":"Technometrics","issued":{"date-parts":[["1975"]]},"language":"en","page":"161-166","title":"A bayesian analysis of a multiplicative treatment effect in weather modification","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},{"id":"skinner_foundations_1978a","abstract":"A two-volume study of political thought from the late thirteenth to the end of the sixteenth century, the decisive period of transition from medieval to modern political theory.

As Quentin Skinner says, 'the intellectual historian can help us to appreciate how far the values embodied in our present way of life, and our present ways of thinking about those values, reflect a series of choices made at different times between different possible worlds'. This essay thus provides one of the most substantial statements yet made about the importance, relevance and potential excitement of this form of historical enquiry.

The first originated in classical antiquity, and lay at the heart of the Roman republican tradition of public life. Thomas Hobbes was the most formidable enemy of this pattern of thought, and his successive attempts to discredit it constitute a truly epochal moment in the history of Anglophone political thought. Hobbes and Republican Liberty develops several of the themes announced by Quentin Skinner in his celebrated inaugural lecture on Liberty before Liberalism of 1997. Cogent, engaged, accessible, and indeed exhilarating, this new book will appeal to readers of history, politics, and philosophy at all levels from upper-undergraduate upwards, and provides an excellent introduction to the work of one of the most celebrated thinkers of our time.","author":[{"family":"Skinner","given":"Quentin"}],"citation-key":"skinner2008hobbes","ISBN":"978-0-521-71416-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",2,21]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"268","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Hobbes and Republican Liberty","type":"book"},{"id":"skinner2012visions","author":[{"family":"Skinner","given":"Quentin"}],"citation-key":"skinner2012visions","event-place":"Cambridge","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"PhilPapers","title":"Visions of Politics, Volume 1: Regarding Method","title-short":"Visions of Politics","type":"book"},{"id":"smith_comparison_1992","author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"H.L."},{"family":"Piland","given":"N.F."},{"family":"Fisher","given":"N."}],"citation-key":"smith_comparison_1992","container-title":"Journal of Rural Health","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]},"language":"en","page":"27-40","title":"A comparison of financial performance, organizational characteristics, and management strategy among rural and urban nursing facilities","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},{"id":"smith2020contextual","abstract":"Advances in how programs treat natural language words have a big impact in AI.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Noah A."}],"citation-key":"smith2020contextual","container-title":"Communications of the ACM","container-title-short":"Commun.

And in making their decisions about meaning appear authoritative and fair, judges often write about the nature of linguistic interpretation. In the first book to examine the linguistic analysis of law, Lawrence M. Solan shows that judges sometimes inaccurately portray the way we use language, creating inconsistencies in their decisions and threatening the fairness of the judicial system. Solan uses a wealth of examples to illustrate the way linguistics enters the process of judicial decision making: a death penalty case that the Supreme Court decided by analyzing the use of adjectives in a jury instruction; criminal cases whose outcomes depend on the Supreme Court’s analysis of the relationship between adverbs and prepositional phrases; and cases focused on the meaning of certain words in the Constitution. Solan finds that judges often describe our use of language poorly because there is no clear relationship between the principles of linguistics and the jurisprudential goals that the judge wishes to promote. A major contribution to the growing interdisciplinary scholarship on law and its social and cultural context, Solan’s lucid, engaging book is equally accessible to linguists, lawyers, philosophers, anthropologists, literary theorists, and political scientists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Solan","given":"Lawrence"}],"citation-key":"solan1993language","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993"]]},"source":"www.press.uchicago.edu","title":"The Language of Judges","type":"book","URL":"https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/L/bo3684176.html"},{"id":"soni2021abolitionist","abstract":"The abolitionist movement of the nineteenth-century United States remains among the most significant social and political movements in US history. Abolitionist newspapers played a crucial role in spreading information and shaping public opinion around a range of issues relating to the abolition of slavery. These newspapers also serve as a primary source of information about the movement for scholars today, resulting in powerful new accounts of the movement and its leaders. This paper supplements recent qualitative work on the role of women in abolition’s vanguard, as well as the role of the Black press, with a quantitative text modeling approach. Using diachronic word embeddings, we identify which newspapers tended to lead lexical semantic innovations — the introduction of new usages of specific words — and which newspapers tended to follow. We then aggregate the evidence across hundreds of changes into a weighted network with the newspapers as nodes; directed edge weights represent the frequency with which each newspaper led the other in the adoption of a lexical semantic change. Analysis of this network reveals pathways of lexical semantic influence, distinguishing leaders from followers, as well as others who stood apart from the semantic changes that swept through this period. More specifically, we find that two newspapers edited by women -- The Provincial Freeman and The Lily -- led a large number of semantic changes in our corpus, lending additional credence to the argument that a multiracial coalition of women led the abolitionist movement in terms of both thought and action. It also contributes additional complexity to the scholarship that has sought to tease apart the relation of the abolitionist movement to the women’s suffrage movement, and the vexed racial politics that characterized their relation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Soni","given":"Sandeep"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Lauren F."},{"family":"Eisenstein","given":"Jacob"}],"citation-key":"soni2021abolitionist","container-title":"Journal of Cultural Analytics","container-title-short":"Journal of Cultural Analytics","DOI":"10.22148/001c.18841","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,18]]},"language":"en","page":"18841","publisher":"Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures","source":"culturalanalytics.org","title":"Abolitionist Networks: Modeling Language Change in Nineteenth-Century Activist Newspapers","title-short":"Abolitionist Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://culturalanalytics.org/article/18841-abolitionist-networks-modeling-language-change-in-nineteenth-century-activist-newspapers","volume":"6"},{"id":"soni2022predicting","abstract":"A standard measure of the influence of a research paper is the number of times it is cited. However, papers may be cited for many reasons, and citation count is not informative about the extent to which a paper affected the content of subsequent publications. We therefore propose a novel method to quantify linguistic influence in timestamped document collections. There are two main steps: first, identify lexical and semantic changes using contextual embeddings and word frequencies; second, aggregate information about these changes into per-document influence parameters by estimating a high-dimensional Hawkes process with a low-rank parameter matrix. The resulting measures of linguistic influence are predictive of future citations. Specifically, the estimate of linguistic influence from the two years after a paper's publication is correlated with and predictive of its citation count in the following three years. This is demonstrated using an online evaluation with incremental temporal training/test splits, in comparison with a strong baseline that includes predictors for initial citation counts, topics, and lexical features.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Soni","given":"Sandeep"},{"family":"Bamman","given":"David"},{"family":"Eisenstein","given":"Jacob"}],"citation-key":"soni2022predicting","container-title":"Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2022","event-place":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","event-title":"Findings 2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12]]},"page":"5700–5716","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","publisher-place":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","source":"ACLWeb","title":"Predicting Long-Term Citations from Short-Term Linguistic Influence","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.418"},{"id":"spargo1910influence","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Spargo","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"spargo1910influence","container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1910"]]},"page":"21-40","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Influence of Karl Marx on Contemporary Socialism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2762990","volume":"16"},{"id":"sperber1996explaining","author":[{"family":"Sperber","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"sperber1996explaining","event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-0-631-20045-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996"]]},"publisher":"Blackwell","publisher-place":"Cambridge","title":"Explaining Culture: A Naturalistic Approach","title-short":"Explaining culture","type":"book"},{"id":"sperber2013karl","abstract":"Finalist for the Pulitzer Prize (Biography) A New York Times Book Review Editors Choice Selection Named one of the Best Books of the Year by Publishers Weekly and Book Riot “Absorbing, meticulously researched....

Based on unprecedented access to the recently opened archives of Marx’s and Engels’s complete writings, Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life provides a historical context for the personal story of one of the most influential and controversial political philosophers in Western history. By removing Marx from the ideological conflicts of the twentieth century that colored his legacy and placing him within “the society and intellectual currents of the nineteenth century” (Ian Kershaw), Sperber is able to present a full portrait of Marx as neither a soothsaying prophet of the modern world nor the author of its darkest atrocities.

Noting that the new voters were generally poorer and less educated than those who already enjoyed the suffrage, we hypothesize that cabinet ministers had strong incentives—relative to other members—to appeal to these new electors with simpler statements during parliamentary debates. We assess this claim with a data set of over half a million speeches for the period between the Great Reform Act and Great War, along with methods for measuring the comprehensibility of texts—which we validate in some detail. The theorized relationship holds: ministers become statistically significantly easier to understand (on average) relative to backbenchers, and this effect occurs almost immediately after the 1868 election.

In contexts that involve two or more agents who have to take account of each others’ deliberation, the counterfactual reasoning may become quite complex. When I deliberate, I have to consider not only what the causal effects would be of alternative choices that I might make, but also what other agents might believe about the potential effects of my choices, and how their alternative possible actions might affect my beliefs. Counter factual possibilities are implicit in the models that game theorists and decision theorists have developed – in the alternative branches in the trees that model extensive form games and the different cells of the matrices of strategic form representations – but much of the reasoning about those possibilities remains in the informal commentary on and motivation for the models developed. Puzzlement is sometimes expressed by game theorists about the relevance of what happens in a game ‘off the equilibrium path’: of what would happen if what is (according to the theory) both true and known by the players to be true were instead false. My aim in this paper is to make some suggestions for clarifying some of the concepts involved in counterfactual reasoning in strategic contexts, both the reasoning of the rational agents being modeled, and the reasoning of the theorist who is doing the modeling, and to bring together some ideas and technical tools developed by philosophers and logicians that I think might be relevant to the analysis of strategic reasoning, and more generally to the conceptual foundations of game theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Stalnaker","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"stalnaker2016knowledge","collection-title":"Springer Graduate Texts in Philosophy","container-title":"Readings in Formal Epistemology: Sourcebook","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-20451-2_42","editor":[{"family":"Arló-Costa","given":"Horacio"},{"family":"Hendricks","given":"Vincent F."},{"family":"Benthem","given":"Johan","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-20451-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"895-922","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Knowledge, Belief and Counterfactual Reasoning in Games","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-20451-2_42"},{"id":"stamatatos2009survey","abstract":"Authorship attribution supported by statistical or computational methods has a long history starting from the 19th century and is marked by the seminal study of Mosteller and Wallace (1964) on the authorship of the disputed “Federalist Papers.” During the last decade, this scientific field has been developed substantially, taking advantage of research advances in areas such as machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing.

Gareth Stedman Jones depicts an era dominated by extraordinary challenges and new notions about God, human capacities, empires, and political systems--and, above all, the shape of the future. In the aftermath of the Battle of Waterloo, a Europe-wide argument began about the industrial transformation of England, the Revolution in France, and the hopes and fears generated by these occurrences. Would the coming age belong to those enthralled by the revolutionary events and ideas that had brought this world into being, or would its inheritors be those who feared and loathed it? Stedman Jones gives weight not only to Marx's views but to the views of those with whom he contended. He shows that Marx was as buffeted as anyone else living through a period that both confirmed and confounded his interpretations--and that ultimately left him with terrible intimations of failure. Karl Marx allows the reader to understand Marx's milieu and development, and makes sense of the devastating impact of new ways of seeing the world conjured up by Kant, Hegel, Feuerbach, Ricardo, Saint-Simon, and others.

Owenites stressed both the extent of uncultivated land and the capacity of science to raise the productivity of the soil. The Owenite case, preached weekly in Owenite Halls of Science, and argued by its leading lecturer, John Watts, made a strong impact upon the young Frederick Engels working in Manchester in 1843–4. His denunciation of political economy in the Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher, heavily dependent upon the Owenite position, was what first encouraged Marx to engage with political economy. Marx initially reiterated the position of Engels and the Owenites in maintaining that population increase pressured means of employment rather than means of subsistence, and that competition rather than overpopulation caused economic crises.

Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man’s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman’s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck’s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics.

Why did abstraction dominate American art, social science, and natural science in the mid-twentieth century? Why, despite opposition, did abstraction and theoretical knowledge flourish across a diverse set of intellectual pursuits during the Cold War? In recovering the centrality of abstraction across a range of modernist projects in the United States, Alma Steingart brings mathematics back into the conversation about midcentury American intellectual thought. The expansion of mathematics in the aftermath of World War II, she demonstrates, was characterized by two opposing tendencies: research in pure mathematics became increasingly abstract and rarified, while research in applied mathematics and mathematical applications grew in prominence as new fields like operations research and game theory brought mathematical knowledge to bear on more domains of knowledge. Both were predicated on the same abstractionist conception of mathematics and were rooted in the same approach: modern axiomatics.   For American mathematicians, the humanities and the sciences did not compete with one another, but instead were two complementary sides of the same epistemological commitment. Steingart further reveals how this mathematical epistemology influenced the sciences and humanities, particularly the postwar social sciences. As mathematics changed, so did the meaning of mathematization.   Axiomatics focuses on American mathematicians during a transformative time, following a series of controversies among mathematicians about the nature of mathematics as a field of study and as a body of knowledge. The ensuing debates offer a window onto the postwar development of mathematics band Cold War epistemology writ large. As Steingart’s history ably demonstrates, mathematics is the social activity in which styles of truth—here, abstraction—become synonymous with ways of knowing.","author":[{"family":"Steingart","given":"Alma"}],"citation-key":"steingart2023axiomatics","ISBN":"978-0-226-82420-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,17]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"300","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Axiomatics: Mathematical Thought and High Modernism","title-short":"Axiomatics","type":"book"},{"id":"stigler_history_1986","author":[{"family":"Stigler","given":"S.M."}],"citation-key":"stigler_history_1986","event-place":"Cambridge, MA","issued":{"date-parts":[["1986"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Belknap Press of Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, MA","title":"The history of statistics","type":"book"},{"id":"stiglitz2010mismeasuring","abstract":"In February of 2008, amid the looming global financial crisis, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France asked Nobel Prize-winning economists Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya Sen, along with the distinguished French economist Jean Paul Fitoussi, to establish a commission of leading economists to study whether Gross Domestic Product (GDP)—the most widely used measure of economic activity—is a reliable indicator of economic and social progress. The Commission was given the further task of laying out an agenda for developing better measures.Mismeasuring Our Lives is the result of this major intellectual effort, one with pressing relevance for anyone engaged in assessing how and whether our economy is serving the needs of our society. The authors offer a sweeping assessment of the limits of GDP as a measurement of the well-being of societies—considering, for example, how GDP overlooks economic inequality (with the result that most people can be worse off even though average income is increasing); and does not factor environmental impacts into economic decisions.In place of GDP, Mismeasuring Our Lives introduces a bold new array of concepts, from sustainable measures of economic welfare, to measures of savings and wealth, to a “green GDP.” At a time when policymakers worldwide are grappling with unprecedented global financial and environmental issues, here is an essential guide to measuring the things that matter.","author":[{"family":"Stiglitz","given":"Joseph E."},{"family":"Sen","given":"Amartya"},{"family":"Fitoussi","given":"Jean-Paul"}],"citation-key":"stiglitz2010mismeasuring","ISBN":"978-1-59558-592-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",4,27]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"174","publisher":"The New Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Mismeasuring Our Lives: Why GDP Doesn't Add Up","title-short":"Mismeasuring Our Lives","type":"book"},{"id":"stine2021computational","abstract":"An underexplored aspect of the abundant linguistic data available for computational analysis is the potential for conducting large-scale comparative analyses between different discourses as a more rigorous complement to existing methods. A significant obstacle in comparative studies is the requirement that a researcher distinguish between discursive distinctions that are superficial and those that reflect deeper, structural relationships between the discourses being compared. In this dissertation, I describe two methodologies for comparing discourses in terms of their underlying structures, drawing on distributional semantic models and information theory. These methodologies are explored within three case studies in which the discourses of several online discussion communities are compared. Two of these cases focus on discourses relating to different religious identities, which are particularly prone to the longstanding problems that arise in comparative studies. These studies indicate that the proposed methodologies provide rigorous means for conducting comparative analyses while generating results that are interpretable and therefore useful within different disciplinary contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Stine","given":"Zachary Kimo"}],"citation-key":"stine2021computational","event-place":"United States -- Arkansas","genre":"Ph.D.","ISBN":"9798496571432","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"English","license":"Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","number-of-pages":"134","publisher":"University of Arkansas at Little Rock","publisher-place":"United States -- Arkansas","source":"ProQuest","title":"Computational Methods for Comparative Analyses of Discourses","type":"thesis","URL":"https://www.proquest.com/docview/2614774935/abstract/E104747E669D4068PQ/1"},{"id":"storey2020two","abstract":"One commonly recognized feature of the Ancient Greek corpus is that later texts frequently imitate and allude to model texts from earlier time periods, but analysis of this phenomenon is mostly done for specific author pairs based on close reading and highly visible instances of imitation.

A political theorist and economist, his worldview was shaped by experiences in the Second World War as an underground political activist in Occupied Belgium and during his subsequent internment in a Nazi prison camp. Mandel’s faith in human nature and in the working classes survived Nazi oppression and the murder of much of his family in the concentration camps. He retained his connection to his Jewish roots throughout his life, but believed that security and liberation for the Jewish people was best achieved through world revolution and universal emancipation rather than nationalism.\n\nA brilliant orator in several languages, Mandel was an indefatigable revolutionary militant and a key leader in the Fourth International, and he had an enormous impact on the thought and practice of the 1968 generation. His writings range from innovative economic and political theory to a study of the Second World War and have been published in over forty languages. His last major work, Late Capitalism, had an influence that reached from the social sciences into the humanities.\n\nBiographer Jan Willem Stutje, the first writer with access to Mandel's archives, has interviewed many of the leading figures in the story and unearthed a wealth of new material, detailing Mandel’s arrest by the Nazis and his role in Latin American guerrilla warfare. He recounts Mandel’s interactions with both scholars — Sartre, Ernst Bloch, Perry Anderson — and comrades-in-arms such as Che Guevara, Rudi Dutschke and Tariq Ali. The book also yields fascinating details of the man's sometimes tragic private life.","author":[{"family":"Stutje","given":"Jan Willem"}],"citation-key":"stutje2009ernest","ISBN":"978-1-84467-316-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",5]]},"page":"392","publisher":"Verso Books","source":"Verso Books","title":"Ernest Mandel: A Rebel's Dream Deferred","title-short":"Ernest Mandel","translator":[{"family":"Drucker","given":"Christopher Beck and Peter"}],"type":"book"},{"id":"sugimoto2016big","abstract":"Perspectives on the varied challenges posed by big data for health, science, law, commerce, and politics.Big data is ubiquitous but heterogeneous.

This book examines big data not as an undifferentiated whole but contextually, investigating the varied challenges posed by big data for health, science, law, commerce, and politics. Taken together, the chapters reveal a complex set of problems, practices, and policies.The advent of big data methodologies has challenged the theory-driven approach to scientific knowledge in favor of a data-driven one. Social media platforms and self-tracking tools change the way we see ourselves and others. The collection of data by corporations and government threatens privacy while promoting transparency. Meanwhile, politicians, policy makers, and ethicists are ill-prepared to deal with big data's ramifications. The contributors look at big data's effect on individuals as it exerts social control through monitoring, mining, and manipulation; big data and society, examining both its empowering and its constraining effects; big data and science, considering issues of data governance, provenance, reuse, and trust; and big data and organizations, discussing data responsibility, “data harm,” and decision making.ContributorsRyan Abbott, Cristina Alaimo, Kent R.

To study the underlying mechanisms, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to visualize Chinese-English bilinguals' brain activity in phonological processing of logographic Chinese and alphabetic English, two written languages with a sharp contrast in phonology and orthography. In Experiment 1, we found that phonological processing of Chinese characters recruits a neural system involving left middle frontal and posterior parietal gyri, cortical regions that are known to contribute to spatial information representation, spatial working memory, and coordination of cognitive resources as a central executive system. We assume that the peak activation of this system is relevant to the unique feature of Chinese that a logographic character has a square configuration that maps onto a monosyllabic unit of speech. Equally important, when our bilingual subjects performed a phonological task on English words, this neural system was most active, whereas brain areas mediating English monolinguals' fine-grained phonemic analysis, as demonstrated by Experiment 2, were only weakly activated. This suggests that our bilingual subjects were applying their L1 system to L2 reading and that the lack of letter-to-sound conversion rules in Chinese led Chinese readers to being less capable of processing English by recourse to an analytic reading system on which English monolinguals rely. Our brain imaging findings lend strongest support to the idea that language experience tunes the cortex.","author":[{"family":"Tan","given":"Li Hai"},{"family":"Spinks","given":"John A."},{"family":"Feng","given":"Ching-Mei"},{"family":"Siok","given":"Wai Ting"},{"family":"Perfetti","given":"Charles A."},{"family":"Xiong","given":"Jinhu"},{"family":"Fox","given":"Peter T."},{"family":"Gao","given":"Jia-Hong"}],"citation-key":"tan2003neural","container-title":"Human Brain Mapping","container-title-short":"Hum Brain Mapp","DOI":"10.1002/hbm.10089","ISSN":"1065-9471","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",3]]},"language":"eng","page":"158-166","PMCID":"PMC6872007","PMID":"12599273","source":"PubMed","title":"Neural systems of second language reading are shaped by native language","type":"article-journal","volume":"18"},{"id":"tarrow2013language","abstract":"This book examines the relations between the material and political bases of contentious politics and the construction, diffusion, and endurance of contentious language.

From a database of nearly 1,000 languages and their basic constituent orders, a sample of 400 languages was produced that is statistically representative of both the genetic and areal distributions of the world's languages. This sample reveals the following relative frequencies (in order from high to low) of basic constituent order types: (1) SOV and SVO, (2) VSO, (3) VOS and OVS, (4) OSV. It is argued that these relative frequencies can be explained to be the result of the possible interactions of three fundamental functional principles of linguistic organization. Principle 1, the thematic information principle, specifies that initial position is the cross-linguistically favoured position for clause-level thematic information. Principle 2, the verb-object bonding principle, describes the cross-linguistic tendency for a transitive verb and its object to form a more tightly integrated unit, syntactically and semantically, than does a transitive verb and its subject. Principle 3, the animated principle, describes the cross-linguistic tendency for semantic arguments which are either more animate or more agentive to occur earlier in the clause. Each principle is motivated independently of the others, drawing on cross-linguistic data from more than 80 genetically and typologically diverse languages. Given these three independently motivated functional principles, it is argued that the relative frequency of basic constituent order types is due to the tendency for the three principles to be maximally realized in the world's languages. SOV and SVO languages are typologically most frequent because such basic orders reflect all three principles. The remaining orders occur less frequently because they reflect fewer of the principles. The 1,000-language database and the genetic and areal classification frames are published as appendices to the volume.","author":[{"family":"Tomlin","given":"Russell S."}],"citation-key":"tomlin2013basic","ISBN":"978-0-415-72357-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,21]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"328","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Google Books","title":"Basic Word Order: Functional Principles","title-short":"Basic Word Order","type":"book"},{"id":"toury1982communication","abstract":"Whether produced by L2 learners or by (more or less) \"true\" bilinguals, experienced or inexperienced in translating as such, translated utterances are imbued with interference forms at one level or another - whether the process occurs between L1 and L2 or vice versa.

These ideas are brought together by a conception of rational action and, therefore, a rationalistic appraisal of welfare and order. By taking this perspective, the usual contrast of market and planning approaches to economic organisation is subsumed by an approach which focuses on the construction of order in economic processes.

This was not because the ordinary business of life was thought unimportant, but because the principles governing economic conduct were thought to be obvious or uncontroversial. The subsequent development of economic writing thus parallels the development of capitalism in Western Europe. From the seventeenth to the twenty-first century there has been a constant shift in content, audience, and form of argument as the literature of economic argument developed. The Economy of the Word proposes that to understand the various forms that economic literature has taken, we need to adopt a more literary approach in economics specifically, to adopt the instruments and techniques of philology. This way we can conceive the history of economic thought to be an on-going work in progress, rather than the story of the emergence of modern economic thinking. This approach demands that we pay attention to the construction of particular texts, showing the work of economic argument in different contexts. In sum, we need to pay attention to the \"economy of the word\".The Economy of the Word is divided into three parts. The first explains what the term \"economy\" has meant from Antiquity to Modernity, coupling this conceptual history with an examination of how the idea of national income was turned into a number during the first half of the twentieth century. The second part is devoted to Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, considering first the manner in which Smith deals with international trade, and then the way in which the book was read in the course of the nineteenth century. Part III examines the sources used by Karl Marx and Léon Walras in developing their economic analysis, drawing attention to their shared intellectual context in French political economy.","author":[{"family":"Tribe","given":"Keith"}],"citation-key":"tribe2015economy","collection-title":"Oxford Studies in the History of Economics","event-place":"Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-19-021161-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"number-of-pages":"352","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford","source":"Oxford University Press","title":"The Economy of the Word: Language, History, and Economics","title-short":"The Economy of the Word","type":"book"},{"id":"tschantz2022what","abstract":"The near universal condemnation of proxy discrimination hides a disagreement over what it is.

Marx's main preoccupation at this time was with man estranged from himself in an alienated world: a subjective, almost religious theme.  Taking full account of these earlier writings, Robert Tucker critiques and reinterprets Marx's thought. He shows how its origins can be located in earlier German philosophers, in particular Kant, Hegel and Feuerbach. Reconstructing the genesis of Marxism in its founder's own mind, he clarifies Marx's mystifying contention that Marxism represented Hegelianism turned 'on its head'. He then presents a new interpretation, based on close textual analysis, of the relation between Marx's early philosophical system and the subsequent materialist conception of history as expounded in the later and best known writings of Marx and Engels. Against this background, Tucker presents Das Kapital as a work belonging to the post-Hegelian mythical development of Germany philosophy. Considering in turn the genesis of Marxism and the underlying continuity of his thought from the early writings to Das Kapital, Tucker shows the theme of alienation is central throughout. In the years since the book was first written, comments and criticism have encouraged Tucker to change his position somewhat. This is explained in a new introduction that goes beyond the interpretative enterprise of the rest of the book to assess Marx in relation to contemporary concerns: first it presents a critique of Marx's treatment of alienation and then it comments on the moot problem of the continuing relevance of his social and economic thought. On the latter point his views have matured and altered during the intervening years and he now finds the economic and social aspects of Marx's thought considerably more relevant than he did before.","author":[{"family":"Tucker","given":"Robert C."}],"citation-key":"tucker1961philosophy","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-7658-0644-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1961"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"263","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Google Books","title":"Philosophy & Myth in Karl Marx","type":"book"},{"id":"tufte1983visual","abstract":"This book deals with the theory and practice in the design of data graphics and makes the point that the most effective way to describe, explore, and summarize a set of numbers is to look at pictures of those numbers, through the use of statistical graphics, charts, and tables.

Male pronouns included he, him, his, himself and female pronouns included she, her, hers, and herself. Between 1900 and 1945, 3.5 male pronouns appeared for every female pronoun, increasing to 4.5 male pronouns during the postwar era of the 1950s and early 1960s. After 1968, the ratio dropped precipitously, reaching 2 male pronouns per female pronoun by the 2000s. From 1968 to 2008, the use of male pronouns decreased as female pronouns increased. The gender pronoun ratio was significantly correlated with indicators of U.S. women’s status such as educational attainment, labor force participation, and age at first marriage as well as women’s assertiveness, a personality trait linked to status. Books used relatively more female pronouns when women’s status was high and fewer when it was low.

It is also a crucial text in elucidating Marx’s debt to the idealist philosopher G.W.F. Hegel. This book, first published in 1988, is the first full-length study of that relationship, in a thorough textual analysis which makes the connections explicit and also the Grundrisse’s relations to the works of Adam Smith and Aristotle. This book argues that Marx’s critique of political economy, and his critique of Hegel, are double interrelated. Not only did Marx adapt Hegelian logic in order to analyse the economic categories crucial to modern society but it is argued that those logical categories were themselves seen as reflections of the productive processes of contemporary commercial society.  Uchida reveals a conceptual structure common to the apparently rarefied world of Hegelian conceptual logic and to the supposedly common-sensical world of economic science. Demonstrating this is a considerable achievement, and it allows us to consider precisely what is valuable today in Marx’s critical commentary on this conceptual structure and on the type of society in which it is manifested. Uchida’s subject, like Marx’s, is ‘the force of capital on modern life’.","author":[{"family":"Uchida","given":"Hiroshi"}],"citation-key":"uchida2015marx","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-317-49783-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",4,17]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"138","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"London","source":"Google Books","title":"Marx's 'Grundrisse' and Hegel's 'Logic'","type":"book"},{"id":"uhl1977lorenz","author":[{"family":"Uhl","given":"Herbert"}],"citation-key":"uhl1977lorenz","issued":{"date-parts":[["1977"]]},"language":"de","number-of-pages":"250","publisher":"na","source":"Google Books","title":"Lorenz von Stein und Karl Marx: Zur Grundlegung von Gesellschaftsanalyse und politischer Theorie 1842-1850","title-short":"Lorenz von Stein und Karl Marx","type":"book"},{"id":"underwood2018historical","abstract":"Measuring similarity is a basic task in information retrieval, and now often a building-block for more complex arguments about cultural change.

Some critics have even charged that Mill's liberalism was part of a political project to restrain, rather than foster, democracy.  Redirecting attention to Mill as a political thinker, Nadia Urbinati argues that this claim misrepresents Mill's thinking. Although he did not elaborate a theory of democracy, Mill did devise new avenues of democratic participation in government that could absorb the transformation of politics engendered by the institution of representation. More generally, Urbinati assesses Mill's contribution to modern democratic theory by critiquing the dominant \"two liberties\" narrative that has shaped Mill scholarship over the last several decades. As Urbinati shows, neither Isaiah Berlin's theory of negative and positive freedom nor Quentin Skinner's theory of liberty as freedom from domination adequately captures Mill's notion of political theory.  Drawing on Mill's often overlooked writings on ancient Greece, Urbinati shows that Mill saw the ideal representative government as a \"polis of the moderns,\" a metamorphosis of the unique features of the Athenian polis: the deliberative character of its institutions and politics; the Socratic ethos; and the cooperative implications of political agonism and dissent. The ancient Greeks, Urbinati shows, and Athenians in particular, are the key to understanding Mill's contribution to modern democratic theory and the theory of political liberty.  Urbinati concludes by demonstrating the importance of Mill's deliberative model of politics to the contemporary debate on liberal and republican views of liberty. Her fresh and persuasive approach not only clarifies Mill's political ideas but also illustrates how they can help enrich our contemporary understanding of democracy.","author":[{"family":"Urbinati","given":"Nadia"}],"citation-key":"urbinati2002mill","ISBN":"978-0-226-84277-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",9]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"306","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Mill on Democracy: From the Athenian Polis to Representative Government","title-short":"Mill on Democracy","type":"book"},{"id":"urbinati2007mill","abstract":"The year 2006 marked the two hundredth anniversary of John Stuart Mill's birth. Though his philosophical reputation has varied greatly, it is now clear that Mill ranks among the most influential modern political thinkers. Despite his enduring influence, the breadth and complexity of Mill's political thought is often underappreciated. While his writings remain a touchstone for debates over liberty and liberalism, many other important dimensions of his political philosophy have until recently been ignored. This book aims to correct such neglect, by illustrating the breadth and depth of Mill's political writings, by drawing together a collection of essays whose authors explore underappreciated elements of Mill's political philosophy. The book shows how Mill's thinking remains pertinent to our own political life in three broad areas - democratic institutions and culture, liberalism, and international politics - and offers a critical reassessment of Mill's political philosophy in light of recent political developments and transformations.","author":[{"family":"Urbinati","given":"Nadia"},{"family":"Zakaras","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"urbinati2007mill","ISBN":"978-1-139-46251-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",1,29]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"349","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"J.S.

Here we juxtapose theory and insights from cultural evolution and social ecology. Evolutionary approaches enable an understanding of the how of cultural change, suggesting transmission mechanisms by which the contents of culture may change. Ecological approaches provide insights into the why of cultural change: They identify specific environmental pressures, which evoke shifts in psychology and thereby enable greater precision in predictions of specific cultural changes based on changes in ecological conditions. Complementary insights from the ecological and cultural evolutionary approaches can jointly clarify the process by which cultures change. We end by discussing the relevance of cultural change research for the contemporary societal shifts and by highlighting several critical challenges and future directions for the emerging field of cross-temporal research on culture and psychology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Varnum","given":"Michael E.

Due to the exceptionally wide influence and reach of Marxist theory, including over 150 years of historical debates and traditions within Marxism, finding a point of entry can be daunting.

Its coverage is more comprehensive than previous volumes on Marx in terms of both foundational concepts and state-of-the-art empirical research on contemporary social problems. It is also provides equal space to sociologists, economists, and political scientists, with substantial contributions from philosophers, historians, and geographers. The Oxford Handbook of Karl Marx consists of six sections. The first section, Foundations, includes chapters that cover the foundational concepts and theories that constitute the core of Marx's theories of history, society, and political economy. This section demonstrates that the core elements of Marx's political economy of capitalism continue to be defended, elaborated, and applied to empirical social science and covers historical materialism, class, capital, labor, value, crisis, ideology, and alienation.

On the basis of these definitions, it shows that structural domination under capitalism presupposes collective power but no joint agency or shared intentions on the part of the dominators.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Vrousalis","given":"Nicholas"}],"citation-key":"vrousalis2021capitalist","container-title":"Journal of Applied Philosophy","DOI":"10.1111/japp.12414","ISSN":"1468-5930","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"40-54","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Capitalist Cage: Structural Domination and Collective Agency in the Market","title-short":"The Capitalist Cage","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/japp.12414","volume":"38"},{"id":"vrousalis2022exploitation","abstract":"Exploitation is a globally pervasive phenomenon. Slavery, serfdom, and the patriarchy are part of its lineage. Temporary and sex workers, commercial surrogacy, precarious labour contracts, sweatshops, and markets in blood, vaccines or human organs, are some contemporary manifestations of exploitation. What makes these exploitative transactions unjust? And is capitalism inherently exploitative? This book offers answers to these two questions. Nicholas Vrousalis argues that exploitation is a form of domination, self-enrichment through the domination of others. On the domination view, exploitation complaints are not, fundamentally, about harm, coercion or unfairness. Rather, they are about who serves whom and why. Exploitation, in a word, is a dividend of servitude: the dividend the powerful extract from the servitude of the vulnerable. Vrousalis claims that this servitude is inherent to capitalist relations between consenting adults whereby capital is monetary control over the labour capacity of others. It follows that capitalism, the mode of production where capital predominates, is an inherently unjust social structure.","author":[{"family":"Vrousalis","given":"Nicholas"}],"citation-key":"vrousalis2022exploitation","ISBN":"978-0-19-269354-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,31]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"211","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Exploitation as Domination: What Makes Capitalism Unjust","title-short":"Exploitation as Domination","type":"book"},{"id":"vygodsky1979kapital","author":[{"family":"Vygodsky","given":"V.

The paper begins by characterizing Stalin's view of Japan and his policy toward Northeast Asia in the early postwar years as generally prudent, as demonstrated by his endorsement of the strategy for a peaceful revolution advocated by Nozaka Sanzō, one of the CPJ leaders. It then examines how, in the aftermath of the successful Chinese Revolution, Stalin changed his policy toward Japan dramatically as he began to encourage the CPJ to pursue a revolution by force and how the CPJ responded to this policy change. This change also prompted North Korea's military assault on the South, and China's participation in the war.Through a multi-dimensional approach, this paper sheds light on the importance of the 'Japan factor' in the Korean War, a factor unduly neglected by previous studies, thereby bearing out that the political process in postwar Japan has been inseparably related to the developments of international politics in Northeast Asia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Wada","given":"Haruki"}],"citation-key":"wada1998korean","container-title":"Social Science Japan Journal","ISSN":"1369-1465","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"page":"5-29","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Korean War, Stalin's Policy, and Japan","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/30209236","volume":"1"},{"id":"wagner2023privacy","abstract":"It is well known that most users do not read privacy policies but almost always tick the box to agree with them. While the length and readability of privacy policies have been well studied and many approaches for policy analysis based on natural language processing have been proposed, existing studies are limited in their depth and scope, often focusing on a small number of data practices at single point in time. In this article, we fill this gap by analyzing the 25-year history of privacy policies using machine learning and natural language processing and presenting a comprehensive analysis of policy contents. Specifically, we collect a large-scale longitudinal corpus of privacy policies from 1996 to 2021 and analyze their content in terms of the data practices they describe, the rights they grant to users, and the rights they reserve for their organizations. We pay particular attention to changes in response to recent privacy regulations such as the GDPR and CCPA. We observe some positive changes, such as reductions in data collection post-GDPR, but also a range of concerning data practices, such as widespread implicit data collection for which users have no meaningful choices or access rights. Our work is an important step toward making privacy policies machine readable on the user side, which would help users match their privacy preferences against the policies offered by web services.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Wagner","given":"Isabel"}],"citation-key":"wagner2023privacy","container-title":"ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security","container-title-short":"ACM Trans.

These models can capture semantic information in large corpora of text by learning distributional properties of words, that is how often particular words appear in specific contexts. Scholars have pointed out the potential of WEMs for historical research. In particular, their ability to capture semantic change might assist historians studying conceptual change or specific discursive formations over time. Concurrently, others voiced their criticism and pointed out that WEMs require large amounts of training data, that they are challenging to evaluate, and they lack the specificity looked for by historians. The ability to examine semantic change resonates with the goals of historians such as Reinhart Koselleck, whose research focused on the formation of concepts and the transformation of semantic fields. However, word embeddings can only be used to study particular types of semantic change, and the model’s use is dependent on the size, quality, and bias in training data.

I was determined to produce a package that could draw every statistical graphic I had ever seen. The structure of the program was a collection of procedures named after the basic graph types they p- duced. The graphics code was roughly one and a half megabytes in size. In the early 1990’s, I redesigned the SYSTAT graphics package using - ject-based technology. I intended to produce a more comprehensive and - namic package. I accomplished this by embedding graphical elements in a tree structure. Rendering graphics was done by walking the tree and editing worked by adding and deleting nodes. The code size fell to under a megabyte. In the late 1990’s, I collaborated with Dan Rope at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Dan Carr at George Mason University to produce a graphics p- duction library called GPL, this time in Java. Our goal was to develop graphics components. This book was nourished by that project.

That is the key question facing Bayesian epistemology. Subjective Bayesians hold that it is largely (though not entirely) up to the agent as to which degrees of belief to adopt. Objective Bayesians, on the other hand, maintain that appropriate degrees of belief are largely (though not entirely) determined by the agent's evidence. This book states and defends a version of objective Bayesian epistemology. According to this version, objective Bayesianism is characterized by three norms: · Probability - degrees of belief should be probabilities · Calibration - they should be calibrated with evidence · Equivocation - they should otherwise equivocate between basic outcomes Objective Bayesianism has been challenged on a number of different fronts. For example, some claim it is poorly motivated, or fails to handle qualitative evidence, or yields counter-intuitive degrees of belief after updating, or suffers from a failure to learn from experience. It has also been accused of being computationally intractable, susceptible to paradox, language dependent, and of not being objective enough. Especially suitable for graduates or researchers in philosophy of science, foundations of statistics and artificial intelligence, the book argues that these criticisms can be met and that objective Bayesianism is a promising theory with an exciting agenda for further research.","author":[{"family":"Williamson","given":"Jon"}],"citation-key":"williamson2010defence","event-place":"Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-19-157613-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",5,13]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"192","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford","source":"Google Books","title":"In Defence of Objective Bayesianism","type":"book"},{"id":"wilson1940finland","abstract":"Edmund Wilson's magnum opus, To the Finland Station, is a stirring account of revolutionary politics, people, and ideas from the French Revolution through the Paris Commune to the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917.

That tree-like reading is recommended by Wittgenstein himself in the sole footnote of his book, in which he suggests that the inner logical structure of the text is set by the decimal numbers of its propositions. “They alone – the Author will add – give the book perspicuity and clearness, and without this numbering it would be an incomprehensible jumble”. Indeed, the compact and intricate sequence of the traditional presentation is only a rigorous logical bet, but only a logical machine or a robot can unravel the tangle: for an ordinary human understanding that does not exploit its numbering, the book remains “an incomprehensible jumble”. In the present disposition, instead, all horizontal and vertical references become directly manifest and any reader can enjoy the fine architecture and the elegant reasoning of Wittgenstein's work. Every page is an actual reading unit, perfectly coherent and complete. The Tractatus becomes comprehensible also to unskilled readers, of course at more or less deep levels, while a scholar or a more practised reader can detect suggestions and meanings that had remained, until now, completely hidden. A historical note shows in which manner the new structural perspective sheds new light also in the compositional manuscript we have, which “writing units” are very similar, actually, to the pages of the present edition. Besides, this allows to rebuild the list of “Supplements” (here in the Appendix) that Wittgenstein gathered after he roughly finished his manuscript, but that he used very little in the final book. Printing the Tractatus following Wittgenstein's decimal prescriptions required meticulous philological care and some discretional conventions: for instance, at the top of each page the commented-upon proposition is printed again, to make the sight complete and self-sufficient. On the other hand, some forcing of the text by the translators in their sequential reading could be eliminated, restoring a more literal translation. Also the famous and intriguing picture of the eye and its visual field (5.6331) has been restored as Wittgenstein drafted it, making the entire page perfectly understandable and coherent. This documented and editorial work on one of the most referenced books of the last century was conceived to obtain, and in fact gained, a perspicuous and crystal clear text, philologically faithful and relaxingly readable at the same time.","author":[{"family":"Wittgenstein","given":"Ludwig"}],"citation-key":"wittgenstein1921tractatus","ISBN":"978-1-78527-658-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1921"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"241","publisher":"Anthem Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus: Centenary Edition","title-short":"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus","type":"book"},{"id":"wittgenstein1953philosophical","abstract":"Incorporating significant editorial changes from earlier editions, the fourth edition of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations is the definitive en face German-English version of the most important work of 20th-century philosophy  The extensively revised English translation incorporates many hundreds of changes to Anscombe’s original translation Footnoted remarks in the earlier editions have now been relocated in the text What was previously referred to as ‘Part 2’ is now republished as Philosophy of Psychology – A Fragment, and all the remarks in it are numbered for ease of reference New detailed editorial endnotes explain decisions of translators and identify references and allusions in Wittgenstein's original text Now features new essays on the history of the Philosophical Investigations, and the problems of translating Wittgenstein’s text","author":[{"family":"Wittgenstein","given":"Ludwig"}],"citation-key":"wittgenstein1953philosophical","ISBN":"978-1-4051-5929-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1953"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"592","publisher":"Wiley","source":"Google Books","title":"Philosophical Investigations","type":"book"},{"id":"wohl1998plato","abstract":"Plato's Epistles are among the most disputed texts of antiquity.

She traces the development of the Western tradition from classical antiquity through to the Middle Ages in the perspective of social history—a significant departure not only from the standard abstract history of ideas but also from other contextual methods. Treating canonical thinkers as passionately engaged human beings, Wood examines their ideas not simply in the context of political languages but as creative responses to the social relations and conflicts of their time and place. She identifies a distinctive relation between property and state in Western history and shows how the canon, while largely the work of members or clients of dominant classes, was shaped by complex interactions among proprietors, labourers and states. Western political theory, Wood argues, owes much of its vigour, and also many ambiguities, to these complex and often contradictory relations. From the Ancient Greek polis of Plato, Aristotle, Aeschylus and Sophocles, through the Roman Republic of Cicero and the Empire of St Paul and St Augustine, to the medieval world of Averroes, Thomas Aquinas and William of Ockham, Citizens to Lords offers a rich, dynamic exploration of thinkers and ideas that have indelibly stamped our modern world.","author":[{"family":"Wood","given":"Ellen Meiksins"}],"citation-key":"wood2008citizens","ISBN":"978-1-84467-706-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"258","publisher":"Verso Books","source":"Google Books","title":"Citizens to Lords: A Social History of Western Political Thought from Antiquity to the Late Middle Ages","title-short":"Citizens to Lords","type":"book"},{"id":"wood2010rethinking","abstract":"A contemporary follow-up to the groundbreaking Power of Maps, this book takes a fresh look at what maps do, whose interests they serve, and how they can be used in surprising, creative, and radical ways.

To understand the foundations of Weber's class analysis one must look beyond his most synoptic treatments of class in Economy and Society and see how his concept of class is intimately linked to his investigations of the broad problem of rationalization in modern society. Class, in these terms, is the way economic power is distributed when economic action is organized to the greatest degree in an instrumentally-rational manner. The problem of exploitation-the extraction of labor effort from workers-is treated, in this framework, primarily as a problem of technical efficiency and economic rationality in creating work incentives and effective discipline.

The author has identified correspondences between the writings of Schoenberg, the early Wittgenstein (the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,  in particular), and the Vienna Circle of philosophers, on a wide range of topics and themes. Issues discussed include the nature and limits of language, musical universals, theoretical conventionalism, word-to-world correspondence in language, the need for a fact- and comparison-based approach to art criticism, and the nature of music-theoretical formalism and mathematical modeling. Schoenberg and Wittgenstein are shown to have shared a vision that is remarkable for its uniformity and balance, one that points toward the reconciliation of the positivist/relativist dualism that has dominated recent discourse in music theory. Contrary to earlier accounts of Schoenberg's harmonic and aesthetic relativism, this study identifies a solid epistemological core underlying his thought, a view that was very much in step with Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle, and thereby with the most vigorous and pivotal developments in early twentieth century intellectual history","author":[{"family":"Wright","given":"James Kenneth"}],"citation-key":"wright2006schoenberg","ISBN":"978-3-03911-287-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"196","publisher":"Peter Lang","source":"Google Books","title":"Schoenberg, Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle","type":"book"},{"id":"wyner2011rule","author":[{"family":"Wyner","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Peters","given":"Wim"}],"citation-key":"wyner2011rule","container-title":"Legal knowledge and information systems","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"113–122","publisher":"IOS Press","title":"On rule extraction from regulations","type":"chapter"},{"id":"yang_lets_2019","abstract":"Modeling what makes a request persuasive—eliciting the desired response from a reader—is critical to the study of propaganda, behavioral economics, and advertising.

Social norms are often sustained by multiple mechanisms, including a desire to coordinate, fear of being sanctioned, signaling membership in a group, or simply following the lead of others. This article shows how stochastic evolutionary game theory can be used to study the resulting dynamics. I illustrate with a variety of examples drawn from economics, sociology, demography, and political science. These include bargaining norms, norms governing the terms of contracts, norms of retirement, dueling, foot binding, medical treatment, and the use of contraceptives. These cases highlight the challenges of applying the theory to empirical cases. They also show that the modern theory of norm dynamics yields insights and predictions that go beyond conventional equilibrium analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Young","given":"H.

For example, Age is a linguistic variable if its values are linguistic rather than numerical, i.e.,young, not young, very young, quite young, old, not very old and not very young, etc., rather than 20, 21,22, 23, In more specific terms, a linguistic variable is characterized by a quintuple (L>, T(L), U,G,M) in which L is the name of the variable; T(L) is the term-set of L, that is, the collection of its linguistic values; U is a universe of discourse; G is a syntactic rule which generates the terms in T(L); and M is a semantic rule which associates with each linguistic value X its meaning, M(X), where M(X) denotes a fuzzy subset of U. The meaning of a linguistic value X is characterized by a compatibility function, c: U → [0,1], which associates with each u in U its compatibility with X. Thus, the compatibility of age 27 with young might be 0.7, while that of 35 might be 0.2. The function of the semantic rule is to relate the compatibilities of the so-called primary terms in a composite linguistic value-e.g., young and old in not very young and not very old-to the compatibility of the composite value. To this end, the hedges such as very, quite, extremely, etc., as well as the connectives and and or are treated as nonlinear operators which modify the meaning of their operands in a specified fashion. The concept of a linguistic variable provides a means of approximate characterization of phenomena which are too complex or too ill-defined to be amenable to description in conventional quantitative terms. In particular, treating Truth as a linguistic variable with values such as true, very true, completely true, not very true, untrue, etc., leads to what is called fuzzy logic. By providing a basis for approximate reasoning, that is, a mode of reasoning which is not exact nor very inexact, such logic may offer a more realistic framework for human reasoning than the traditional two-valued logic. It is shown that probabilities, too, can be treated as linguistic variables with values such as likely, very likely, unlikely, etc. Computation with linguistic probabilities requires the solution of nonlinear programs and leads to results which are imprecise to the same degree as the underlying probabilities. The main applications of the linguistic approach lie in the realm of humanistic systems-especially in the fields of artificial intelligence, linguistics, human decision processes, pattern recognition, psychology, law, medical diagnosis, information retrieval, economics and related areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Zadeh","given":"L.

While being largely invisible, translation and interpreting activities are interwoven with political communication, both in contexts of direct negotiations among the parties involved and when the media act as a mediating agent by recontextualising political statements and documents across languages and cultures. This article examines two such episodes at times of diplomatic crisis and war. The first concerns the statement made by the Japanese prime minister after the Potsdam ultimatum in 1945; the second concerns remarks by the Iranian president during the conference ‘A World without Zionism’ in 2005. After a discussion of the linguistic features of the source and translated statements, and of their interpretation and use, it is argued that the translation strategies adopted by the media contribute to actively shape international relations, and that translation activities deserve to be attentively taken into consideration by policy and opinion makers, as well as by the general public.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zanettin","given":"Federico"}],"citation-key":"zanettin2016deadliest","container-title":"The Translator","DOI":"10.1080/13556509.2016.1149754","ISSN":"1355-6509","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,1]]},"page":"303-318","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"`The deadliest error': Translation, international relations and the news media","title-short":"The Deadliest Error","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13556509.2016.1149754","volume":"22"},{"id":"zeng2020what","abstract":"In our world with full of uncertainty, debates and argumentation contribute to the progress of science and society. Despite of the increasing attention to characterize human arguments, most progress made so far focus on the debate outcome, largely ignoring the dynamic patterns in argumentation processes. This paper presents a study that automatically analyzes the key factors in argument persuasiveness, beyond simply predicting who will persuade whom. Specifically, we propose a novel neural model that is able to dynamically track the changes of latent topics and discourse in argumentative conversations, allowing the investigation of their roles in influencing the outcomes of persuasion. Extensive experiments have been conducted on argumentative conversations on both social media and supreme court. The results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models in identifying persuasive arguments via explicitly exploring dynamic factors of topic and discourse. We further analyze the effects of topics and discourse on persuasiveness, and find that they are both useful — topics provide concrete evidence while superior discourse styles may bias participants, especially in social media arguments. In addition, we draw some findings from our empirical results, which will help people better engage in future persuasive conversations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Zeng","given":"Jichuan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jing"},{"family":"He","given":"Yulan"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Cuiyun"},{"family":"Lyu","given":"Michael"},{"family":"King","given":"Irwin"}],"citation-key":"zeng2020what","collection-title":"WWW '20","container-title":"Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020","DOI":"10.1145/3366423.3380223","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-4503-7023-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,20]]},"page":"1502–1513","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"What Changed Your Mind: The Roles of Dynamic Topics and Discourse in Argumentation Process","title-short":"What Changed Your Mind","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3366423.3380223"},{"id":"zeni2016gaiust","abstract":"Semantic annotation technologies support the extraction of legal concepts, for example rights and obligations, from legal documents.

There is a constant barrage of social expectations that teach us that being imperfect is synonymous with being inadequate. Everywhere we turn, there are messages that tell us who, what and how we’re supposed to be. So, we learn to hide our struggles and protect ourselves from shame, judgment, criticism and blame by seeking safety in pretending and perfection. Brené Brown, PhD, LMSW, is the leading authority on the power of vulnerability, and has inspired thousands through her top-selling books Daring Greatly, Rising Strong, and The Gifts of Imperfection, her wildly popular TEDx talks, and a PBS special. Based on seven years of her ground-breaking research and hundreds of interviews, I Thought It Was Just Me shines a long-overdue light on an important truth: Our imperfections are what connect us to each other and to our humanity. Our vulnerabilities are not weaknesses; they are powerful reminders to keep our hearts and minds open to the reality that we’re all in this together. Brown writes, “We need our lives back. It’s time to reclaim the gifts of imperfection—the courage to be real, the compassion we need to love ourselves and others, and the connection that gives true purpose and meaning to life. These are the gifts that bring love, laughter, gratitude, empathy and joy into our lives.”","ISBN":"978-1-59240-335-6","language":"en","note":"Google-Books-ID: VT7ZCwAAQBAJ","number-of-pages":"338","publisher":"Penguin Publishing Group","source":"Google Books","title":"I Thought It Was Just Me (but it Isn't): Making the Journey from \"What Will People Think?\" to \"I Am Enough\"","title-short":"I Thought It Was Just Me (but it Isn't)","author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Brené"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"citation-key":"brown_thought_2007","library":"My Library","citekey":"brown_thought_2007"}]
