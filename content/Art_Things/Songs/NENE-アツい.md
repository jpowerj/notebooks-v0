I can't stop listening ðŸ˜± it's like, 2004 Kanye [[Chipmunk_Soul]], but then fast-forwarded 20 years so that now there's a bunch of [[808]]s on it and it's way more staccato[^1], and it has some sort of fancy gated reverb type thing[^2].

# Footnotes

[^1]: Meaning, just, way choppier--how the piano kinda suddenly appears and then cuts out, whereas in [[Chipmunk_Soul|chipmunk soul]] you'd have more legato (aka held-out/sustained) piano notes/chords.
[^2]: I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to [[reverb]]--I'm trying to learn!--so when I say "gated" here I just mean that it sometimes sounds like the reverb is "fading in", whereas regular reverb would be just the sound faintly fading out...
