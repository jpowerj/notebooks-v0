Kind of... the main reason I made this thing in the first place. Trying to go back to my undergrad days to re-learn as much as I can from Field Theory (MATH404...) and eventually wrap my head around the [[Insolubility_of_the_Quintic|Insolubility of the Quintic]]!

So... the basic building block is a [[Group]]!
