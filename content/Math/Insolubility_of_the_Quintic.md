At some point in studying Algebra, we learn about the Quadratic Equation: given a polynomial equation of the form
$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0,
$$
mathematicians derived a **closed-form** solution, instantly giving us the two solutions:
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
$$
In Medieval Italy, mathematicians further developed a **cubic equation**, giving us the three solutions to
$$
ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0,
$$
and then the **quartic** equation, giving us the four solutions to
$$
ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0.
$$
But then they seemed stumped after this conquest of **fourth-degree** polynomial equations. There seemed to be something qualitatively different about **fifth-degree**, or **quintic** polynomial equations.

Long story short, a 20-year-old named [[Evariste_Galois|Evariste Galois]] frantically wrote down a **proof** while languishing in prison for his participation in the [[July Revolution]],
