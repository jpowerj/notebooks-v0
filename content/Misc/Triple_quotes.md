title: Triple Quotes
---
When a word is so absurdly ideologically laden that, in my mind, it has completely lost meaning, I like to use triple quotes around the term, to indicate that I'm using it begrudgingly:

<!--
```dataview
LIST
FROM #Triple_Quoted 
```
-->

<!-- QueryToSerialize: LIST FROM #Triple_Quoted -->
<!-- SerializedQuery: LIST FROM #Triple_Quoted -->
- [[The_World/Terrorism.md|Terrorism]]
- [[The_World/Vietnam_War.md|Vietnam_War]]
<!-- SerializedQuery END -->
