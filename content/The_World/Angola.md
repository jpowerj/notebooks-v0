I spent a *lot* of time trying to wrap my mind around Angola for the dissertation, since it's basically where [[Cuba]] got the ball rolling in terms of driving [[Apartheid]] out of [[Southern_Africa]]. Basically, when the dust settled from the [[First Angolan Civil War]] with the [[MPLA]] in control over most of the country[^1], it became a forward base from which Angolan and [[Cuba|Cuban]] troops could (a) defend against [[SADF]] incursions, (b) train fighters from [[Southern_Africa|neighboring countries]], and then (c) launch joint attacks against, for example, South African troops in [[Occupied_Namibia|Occupied Namibia]].
