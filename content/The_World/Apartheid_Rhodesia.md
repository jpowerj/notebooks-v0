Apartheid state ruled by a tiny white minority (even smaller than the white minority in [[Apartheid_South_Africa]]), eventually overthrown by guerrilla fighters from [[ZANU]] and [[ZAPU]] and renamed [[Zimbabwe]].

Somehow during my K-12 education, despite it being (imo) the biggest victory for justice in... possibly the entire 20th century, I learned close to nothing about the liberation of those living under [[Apartheid]] regimes in [[Southern_Africa]] (Rhodesia in 1980, [[Namibia]] in 1990, and finally [[South Africa]] in 1994). Even into... the end of undergrad, I don't think I knew that there were **multiple** apartheid regimes throughout [[Southern_Africa]]. Knowing this history would have helped me a whole lot in terms of understanding [[whiteness]] on a world scale, for example, since a key aspect of the defeat of these apartheid regimes was precisely that [[Afrikaaners]] in South Africa--despite being white themselves--felt a type of antipathy towards the [[British_Colonialism|British-descended]] whites of Rhodesia, given that they themselves had been placed into [[concentration camps]] by those very same [[British_Colonialism|British whites]] during the [[Boer War]] ~60 years prior to the [[Rhodesian_UDI|Rhodesian UDI]].
