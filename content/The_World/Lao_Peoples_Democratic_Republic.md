I am... really obsessed with learning about Laos, for the simple reason that:
* Even though the US basically nearly annihilated it out of existence in the late 1960s, along with [[Vietnam]] and (to an only-slightly-lesser extent) [[Kampuchea]]...
* In the US we learn about this destruction of an entire subcontinent as the [["""Vietnam War"""]] rather than the [[Second_Indochina_War|Second Indochina War]].
